35,
35,The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him)
35,was expounding a recondite matter to us. His grey eyes shone and
35,"twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The"
35,"fire burned brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent"
35,lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and
35,"passed in our glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and"
35,"caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that"
35,luxurious after-dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully
35,free of the trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this
35,way--marking the points with a lean forefinger--as we sat and lazily
35,admired his earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it)
35,and his fecundity.
35,
35,'You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two
35,"ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for"
35,"instance, they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.'"
35,
35,'Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?'
35,"said Filby, an argumentative person with red hair."
35,
35,'I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable
35,ground for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You
35,"know of course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_,"
35,has no real existence. They taught you that? Neither has a
35,mathematical plane. These things are mere abstractions.'
35,
35,"'That is all right,' said the Psychologist."
35,
35,"'Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a"
35,real existence.'
35,
35,"'There I object,' said Filby. 'Of course a solid body may exist. All"
35,real things--'
35,
35,'So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_
35,cube exist?'
35,
35,"'Don't follow you,' said Filby."
35,
35,"'Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real"
35,existence?'
35,
35,"Filby became pensive. 'Clearly,' the Time Traveller proceeded, 'any"
35,real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have
35,"Length, Breadth, Thickness, and--Duration. But through a natural"
35,"infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we"
35,"incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions,"
35,"three which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time."
35,"There is, however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between"
35,"the former three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that"
35,our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the
35,latter from the beginning to the end of our lives.'
35,
35,"'That,' said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight"
35,his cigar over the lamp; 'that ... very clear indeed.'
35,
35,"'Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,'"
35,"continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of"
35,"cheerfulness. 'Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension,"
35,though some people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know
35,they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. _There is
35,no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space
35,except that our consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish
35,people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all
35,heard what they have to say about this Fourth Dimension?'
35,
35,"'_I_ have not,' said the Provincial Mayor."
35,
35,"'It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is"
35,"spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,"
35,"Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to"
35,"three planes, each at right angles to the others. But some"
35,philosophical people have been asking why _three_ dimensions
35,particularly--why not another direction at right angles to the other
35,three?--and have even tried to construct a Four-Dimension geometry.
35,Professor Simon Newcomb was expounding this to the New York
35,Mathematical Society only a month or so ago. You know how on a flat
35,"surface, which has only two dimensions, we can represent a figure of"
35,"a three-dimensional solid, and similarly they think that by models"
35,of three dimensions they could represent one of four--if they could
35,master the perspective of the thing. See?'
35,
35,"'I think so,' murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his"
35,"brows, he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one"
35,"who repeats mystic words. 'Yes, I think I see it now,' he said after"
35,"some time, brightening in a quite transitory manner."
35,
35,"'Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this"
35,geometry of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results
35,"are curious. For instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight"
35,"years old, another at fifteen, another at seventeen, another at"
35,"twenty-three, and so on. All these are evidently sections, as it"
35,"were, Three-Dimensional representations of his Four-Dimensioned"
35,"being, which is a fixed and unalterable thing."
35,
35,"'Scientific people,' proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause"
35,"required for the proper assimilation of this, 'know very well that"
35,"Time is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram,"
35,a weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the
35,"movement of the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night"
35,"it fell, then this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to"
35,here. Surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the
35,dimensions of Space generally recognized? But certainly it traced
35,"such a line, and that line, therefore, we must conclude was along"
35,the Time-Dimension.'
35,
35,"'But,' said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, 'if"
35,"Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why"
35,"has it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot"
35,we move in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?'
35,
35,The Time Traveller smiled. 'Are you sure we can move freely in
35,"Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,"
35,and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two
35,dimensions. But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.'
35,
35,"'Not exactly,' said the Medical Man. 'There are balloons.'"
35,
35,"'But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the"
35,"inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical"
35,movement.'
35,
35,"'Still they could move a little up and down,' said the Medical Man."
35,
35,"'Easier, far easier down than up.'"
35,
35,"'And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the"
35,present moment.'
35,
35,"'My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where"
35,the whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the
35,"present moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have"
35,"no dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform"
35,velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_
35,if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth's surface.'
35,
35,"'But the great difficulty is this,' interrupted the Psychologist."
35,"'You _can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot"
35,move about in Time.'
35,
35,'That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say
35,"that we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling"
35,an incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence:
35,"I become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of"
35,"course we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any"
35,more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the
35,ground. But a civilized man is better off than the savage in this
35,"respect. He can go up against gravitation in a balloon, and why"
35,should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or
35,"accelerate his drift along the Time-Dimension, or even turn about"
35,and travel the other way?'
35,
35,"'Oh, _this_,' began Filby, 'is all--'"
35,
35,'Why not?' said the Time Traveller.
35,
35,"'It's against reason,' said Filby."
35,
35,'What reason?' said the Time Traveller.
35,
35,"'You can show black is white by argument,' said Filby, 'but you will"
35,never convince me.'
35,
35,"'Possibly not,' said the Time Traveller. 'But now you begin to see"
35,the object of my investigations into the geometry of Four
35,Dimensions. Long ago I had a vague inkling of a machine--'
35,
35,'To travel through Time!' exclaimed the Very Young Man.
35,
35,"'That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time,"
35,as the driver determines.'
35,
35,Filby contented himself with laughter.
35,
35,"'But I have experimental verification,' said the Time Traveller."
35,
35,"'It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,' the"
35,Psychologist suggested. 'One might travel back and verify the
35,"accepted account of the Battle of Hastings, for instance!'"
35,
35,'Don't you think you would attract attention?' said the Medical Man.
35,'Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.'
35,
35,"'One might get one's Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,'"
35,the Very Young Man thought.
35,
35,'In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go.
35,The German scholars have improved Greek so much.'
35,
35,"'Then there is the future,' said the Very Young Man. 'Just think!"
35,"One might invest all one's money, leave it to accumulate at"
35,"interest, and hurry on ahead!'"
35,
35,"'To discover a society,' said I, 'erected on a strictly communistic"
35,basis.'
35,
35,'Of all the wild extravagant theories!' began the Psychologist.
35,
35,"'Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until--'"
35,
35,'Experimental verification!' cried I. 'You are going to verify
35,_that_?'
35,
35,"'The experiment!' cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary."
35,
35,"'Let's see your experiment anyhow,' said the Psychologist, 'though"
35,"it's all humbug, you know.'"
35,
35,"The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly,"
35,"and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly"
35,"out of the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long"
35,passage to his laboratory.
35,
35,The Psychologist looked at us. 'I wonder what he's got?'
35,
35,"'Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,' said the Medical Man, and"
35,Filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at Burslem; but
35,"before he had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and"
35,Filby's anecdote collapsed.
35,
35,The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering
35,"metallic framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very"
35,"delicately made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent"
35,"crystalline substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that"
35,follows--unless his explanation is to be accepted--is an absolutely
35,unaccountable thing. He took one of the small octagonal tables that
35,"were scattered about the room, and set it in front of the fire, with"
35,two legs on the hearthrug. On this table he placed the mechanism.
35,"Then he drew up a chair, and sat down. The only other object on the"
35,"table was a small shaded lamp, the bright light of which fell upon"
35,"the model. There were also perhaps a dozen candles about, two in"
35,"brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces, so that"
35,the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat in a low arm-chair
35,"nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to be almost between"
35,"the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat behind him, looking"
35,over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the Provincial Mayor watched
35,"him in profile from the right, the Psychologist from the left. The"
35,Very Young Man stood behind the Psychologist. We were all on the
35,"alert. It appears incredible to me that any kind of trick, however"
35,"subtly conceived and however adroitly done, could have been played"
35,upon us under these conditions.
35,
35,"The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. 'Well?'"
35,said the Psychologist.
35,
35,"'This little affair,' said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows"
35,"upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus,"
35,'is only a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through
35,"time. You will notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there"
35,"is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in"
35,"some way unreal.' He pointed to the part with his finger. 'Also,"
35,"here is one little white lever, and here is another.'"
35,
35,The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing.
35,"'It's beautifully made,' he said."
35,
35,"'It took two years to make,' retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when"
35,"we had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: 'Now I"
35,"want you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over,"
35,"sends the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses"
35,the motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller.
35,"Presently I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will"
35,"go. It will vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a"
35,"good look at the thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy"
35,"yourselves there is no trickery. I don't want to waste this model,"
35,and then be told I'm a quack.'
35,
35,There was a minute's pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to
35,"speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth"
35,"his finger towards the lever. 'No,' he said suddenly. 'Lend me your"
35,"hand.' And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual's"
35,hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it
35,was the Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine
35,on its interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am
35,absolutely certain there was no trickery. There was a breath of
35,"wind, and the lamp flame jumped. One of the candles on the mantel"
35,"was blown out, and the little machine suddenly swung round, became"
35,"indistinct, was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps, as an eddy of"
35,faintly glittering brass and ivory; and it was gone--vanished! Save
35,for the lamp the table was bare.
35,
35,Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned.
35,
35,"The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked"
35,under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully.
35,"'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then,"
35,"getting up, he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his"
35,back to us began to fill his pipe.
35,
35,"We stared at each other. 'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you"
35,in earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine
35,has travelled into time?'
35,
35,"'Certainly,' said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at"
35,"the fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the"
35,"Psychologist's face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not"
35,"unhinged, helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.)"
35,"'What is more, I have a big machine nearly finished in there'--he"
35,indicated the laboratory--'and when that is put together I mean to
35,have a journey on my own account.'
35,
35,'You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?'
35,said Filby.
35,
35,"'Into the future or the past--I don't, for certain, know which.'"
35,
35,After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. 'It must have
35,"gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,' he said."
35,
35,'Why?' said the Time Traveller.
35,
35,"'Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it"
35,"travelled into the future it would still be here all this time,"
35,since it must have travelled through this time.'
35,
35,"'But,' I said, 'If it travelled into the past it would have been"
35,visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we
35,were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!'
35,
35,"'Serious objections,' remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of"
35,"impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller."
35,
35,"'Not a bit,' said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: 'You"
35,"think. You can explain that. It's presentation below the threshold,"
35,"you know, diluted presentation.'"
35,
35,"'Of course,' said the Psychologist, and reassured us. 'That's a"
35,simple point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It's plain
35,"enough, and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor"
35,"can we appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of"
35,"a wheel spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is"
35,travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than
35,"we are, if it gets through a minute while we get through a second,"
35,the impression it creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or
35,one-hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in
35,time. That's plain enough.' He passed his hand through the space in
35,"which the machine had been. 'You see?' he said, laughing."
35,
35,We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the
35,Time Traveller asked us what we thought of it all.
35,
35,"'It sounds plausible enough to-night,' said the Medical Man; 'but"
35,wait until to-morrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.'
35,
35,'Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?' asked the Time
35,"Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the"
35,"way down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember"
35,"vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette,"
35,"the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but"
35,"incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger"
35,edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before
35,"our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly"
35,been filed or sawn out of rock crystal. The thing was generally
35,"complete, but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the"
35,"bench beside some sheets of drawings, and I took one up for a better"
35,look at it. Quartz it seemed to be.
35,
35,"'Look here,' said the Medical Man, 'are you perfectly serious?"
35,Or is this a trick--like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?'
35,
35,"'Upon that machine,' said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp"
35,"aloft, 'I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more"
35,serious in my life.'
35,
35,None of us quite knew how to take it.
35,
35,"I caught Filby's eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he"
35,winked at me solemnly.
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,II
35,
35,
35,I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time
35,"Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who"
35,are too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round
35,"him; you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in"
35,"ambush, behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and"
35,"explained the matter in the Time Traveller's words, we should have"
35,shown _him_ far less scepticism. For we should have perceived his
35,motives; a pork butcher could understand Filby. But the Time
35,"Traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements, and we"
35,distrusted him. Things that would have made the frame of a less
35,clever man seemed tricks in his hands. It is a mistake to do things
35,too easily. The serious people who took him seriously never felt
35,quite sure of his deportment; they were somehow aware that trusting
35,their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a
35,nursery with egg-shell china. So I don't think any of us said very
35,much about time travelling in the interval between that Thursday and
35,"the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in most of"
35,"our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical incredibleness,"
35,the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it
35,"suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied with the"
35,"trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the Medical Man,"
35,whom I met on Friday at the Linnaean. He said he had seen a similar
35,"thing at Tubingen, and laid considerable stress on the blowing out"
35,of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not explain.
35,
35,The next Thursday I went again to Richmond--I suppose I was one of
35,"the Time Traveller's most constant guests--and, arriving late, found"
35,four or five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical
35,Man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand
35,"and his watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller,"
35,"and--'It's half-past seven now,' said the Medical Man. 'I suppose"
35,we'd better have dinner?'
35,
35,"'Where's----?' said I, naming our host."
35,
35,'You've just come? It's rather odd. He's unavoidably detained. He
35,asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he's not
35,back. Says he'll explain when he comes.'
35,
35,"'It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,' said the Editor of a"
35,well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell.
35,
35,The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself
35,"who had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the"
35,"Editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another--a quiet,"
35,"shy man with a beard--whom I didn't know, and who, as far as my"
35,"observation went, never opened his mouth all the evening. There was"
35,some speculation at the dinner-table about the Time Traveller's
35,"absence, and I suggested time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit."
35,"The Editor wanted that explained to him, and the Psychologist"
35,volunteered a wooden account of the 'ingenious paradox and trick' we
35,had witnessed that day week. He was in the midst of his exposition
35,when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise. I
35,"was facing the door, and saw it first. 'Hallo!' I said. 'At last!'"
35,"And the door opened wider, and the Time Traveller stood before us."
35,"I gave a cry of surprise. 'Good heavens! man, what's the matter?'"
35,"cried the Medical Man, who saw him next. And the whole tableful"
35,turned towards the door.
35,
35,"He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and"
35,"smeared with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it"
35,seemed to me greyer--either with dust and dirt or because its colour
35,had actually faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown
35,"cut on it--a cut half healed; his expression was haggard and drawn,"
35,"as by intense suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway,"
35,as if he had been dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room.
35,He walked with just such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps.
35,"We stared at him in silence, expecting him to speak."
35,
35,"He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a"
35,"motion towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and"
35,"pushed it towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good:"
35,"for he looked round the table, and the ghost of his old smile"
35,"flickered across his face. 'What on earth have you been up to, man?'"
35,said the Doctor. The Time Traveller did not seem to hear. 'Don't let
35,"me disturb you,' he said, with a certain faltering articulation."
35,"'I'm all right.' He stopped, held out his glass for more, and took"
35,"it off at a draught. 'That's good,' he said. His eyes grew brighter,"
35,and a faint colour came into his cheeks. His glance flickered over
35,"our faces with a certain dull approval, and then went round the warm"
35,"and comfortable room. Then he spoke again, still as it were feeling"
35,"his way among his words. 'I'm going to wash and dress, and then I'll"
35,come down and explain things ... Save me some of that mutton. I'm
35,starving for a bit of meat.'
35,
35,"He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he"
35,"was all right. The Editor began a question. 'Tell you presently,'"
35,said the Time Traveller. 'I'm--funny! Be all right in a minute.'
35,
35,"He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again"
35,"I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall,"
35,"and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had"
35,"nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the"
35,"door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered"
35,"how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my"
35,"mind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent"
35,"Scientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in"
35,headlines. And this brought my attention back to the bright
35,dinner-table.
35,
35,'What's the game?' said the Journalist. 'Has he been doing the
35,"Amateur Cadger? I don't follow.' I met the eye of the Psychologist,"
35,and read my own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time
35,Traveller limping painfully upstairs. I don't think any one else had
35,noticed his lameness.
35,
35,The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical
35,"Man, who rang the bell--the Time Traveller hated to have servants"
35,waiting at dinner--for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his
35,"knife and fork with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The"
35,"dinner was resumed. Conversation was exclamatory for a little while,"
35,with gaps of wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his
35,curiosity. 'Does our friend eke out his modest income with a
35,crossing? or has he his Nebuchadnezzar phases?' he inquired. 'I feel
35,"assured it's this business of the Time Machine,' I said, and took up"
35,the Psychologist's account of our previous meeting. The new guests
35,were frankly incredulous. The Editor raised objections. 'What _was_
35,this time travelling? A man couldn't cover himself with dust by
35,"rolling in a paradox, could he?' And then, as the idea came home to"
35,"him, he resorted to caricature. Hadn't they any clothes-brushes in"
35,"the Future? The Journalist too, would not believe at any price, and"
35,joined the Editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole
35,"thing. They were both the new kind of journalist--very joyous,"
35,irreverent young men. 'Our Special Correspondent in the Day
35,"after To-morrow reports,' the Journalist was saying--or rather"
35,shouting--when the Time Traveller came back. He was dressed in
35,"ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look remained"
35,of the change that had startled me.
35,
35,"'I say,' said the Editor hilariously, 'these chaps here say you have"
35,been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about
35,"little Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?'"
35,
35,The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a
35,"word. He smiled quietly, in his old way. 'Where's my mutton?' he"
35,said. 'What a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!'
35,
35,'Story!' cried the Editor.
35,
35,'Story be damned!' said the Time Traveller. 'I want something to
35,eat. I won't say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries.
35,Thanks. And the salt.'
35,
35,"'One word,' said I. 'Have you been time travelling?'"
35,
35,"'Yes,' said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his"
35,head.
35,
35,"'I'd give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,' said the Editor."
35,The Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang
35,"it with his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been"
35,"staring at his face, started convulsively, and poured him wine."
35,"The rest of the dinner was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden"
35,"questions kept on rising to my lips, and I dare say it was the same"
35,with the others. The Journalist tried to relieve the tension by
35,telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The Time Traveller devoted his
35,"attention to his dinner, and displayed the appetite of a tramp."
35,"The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched the Time Traveller"
35,through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even more clumsy than
35,"usual, and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of"
35,"sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller pushed his plate away,"
35,"and looked round us. 'I suppose I must apologize,' he said. 'I was"
35,simply starving. I've had a most amazing time.' He reached out his
35,"hand for a cigar, and cut the end. 'But come into the smoking-room."
35,It's too long a story to tell over greasy plates.' And ringing the
35,"bell in passing, he led the way into the adjoining room."
35,
35,"'You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?' he"
35,"said to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new"
35,guests.
35,
35,"'But the thing's a mere paradox,' said the Editor."
35,
35,"'I can't argue to-night. I don't mind telling you the story, but"
35,"I can't argue. I will,' he went on, 'tell you the story of what"
35,"has happened to me, if you like, but you must refrain from"
35,interruptions. I want to tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like
35,"lying. So be it! It's true--every word of it, all the same. I was in"
35,"my laboratory at four o'clock, and since then ... I've lived eight"
35,days ... such days as no human being ever lived before! I'm nearly
35,"worn out, but I shan't sleep till I've told this thing over to you."
35,Then I shall go to bed. But no interruptions! Is it agreed?'
35,
35,"'Agreed,' said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed 'Agreed.' And"
35,with that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth.
35,"He sat back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man."
35,Afterwards he got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only
35,"too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink--and, above all, my"
35,"own inadequacy--to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,"
35,"attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker's white,"
35,"sincere face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the"
35,intonation of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed
35,"the turns of his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the"
35,"candles in the smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face"
35,of the Journalist and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees
35,downward were illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each
35,"other. After a time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the"
35,Time Traveller's face.
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,III
35,
35,
35,'I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time
35,"Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the"
35,"workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of"
35,"the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of"
35,"it's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday,"
35,"when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the"
35,"nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get"
35,remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It
35,was at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began
35,"its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put"
35,"one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the"
35,saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels
35,much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took
35,"the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other,"
35,"pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to"
35,"reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round,"
35,I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For
35,a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted
35,"the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute"
35,or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!
35,
35,"'I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both"
35,"hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went"
35,"dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing"
35,"me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to"
35,"traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room"
35,like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The
35,"night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment"
35,"came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter"
35,"and ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night"
35,"again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled"
35,"my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind."
35,
35,'I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time
35,travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling
35,exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong
35,"motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent"
35,"smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a"
35,black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to
35,"fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky,"
35,"leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed"
35,the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air.
35,"I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too"
35,fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that
35,ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of
35,"darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the"
35,"intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her"
35,"quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling"
35,"stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the"
35,palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness;
35,"the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous"
35,color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak
35,"of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating"
35,"band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a"
35,brighter circle flickering in the blue.
35,
35,'The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side
35,"upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me"
35,"grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour,"
35,"now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away."
35,"I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams."
35,The whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing
35,under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my
35,speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun
35,"belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or"
35,"less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and"
35,"minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and"
35,"vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring."
35,
35,'The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They
35,merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked
35,"indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to"
35,"account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a"
35,"kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At"
35,"first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but"
35,these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions
35,grew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain
35,dread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What
35,"strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our"
35,"rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to"
35,look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated
35,before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about
35,"me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it"
35,"seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the"
35,"hill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even"
35,through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so
35,my mind came round to the business of stopping.
35,
35,'The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some
35,"substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long"
35,"as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely"
35,"mattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour"
35,through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to
35,"a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into"
35,whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate
35,contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical
35,"reaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion--would result, and blow"
35,myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the
35,Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I
35,was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an
35,unavoidable risk--one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the
35,"risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light."
35,"The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything,"
35,"the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the"
35,"feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told"
35,"myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I"
35,"resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over"
35,"the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was"
35,flung headlong through the air.
35,
35,'There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have
35,"been stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me,"
35,and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine.
35,"Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the"
35,confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what
35,"seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron"
35,"bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were"
35,dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The
35,"rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove"
35,along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin.
35,"""Fine hospitality,"" said I, ""to a man who has travelled innumerable"
35,"years to see you."""
35,
35,'Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and
35,"looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white"
35,"stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy"
35,downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.
35,
35,'My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail
35,"grew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very"
35,"large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white"
35,"marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings,"
35,"instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so"
35,"that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of"
35,"bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was"
35,towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the
35,"faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn,"
35,and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood
35,"looking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an"
35,hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it
35,denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and
35,"saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was"
35,lightening with the promise of the sun.
35,
35,"'I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full"
35,temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when
35,that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have
35,happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion?
35,What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had
35,"developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly"
35,"powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more"
35,dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to
35,be incontinently slain.
35,
35,'Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate
35,"parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping"
35,in upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic
35,"fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to"
35,readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the
35,thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like
35,"the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue"
35,"of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into"
35,nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and
35,"distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out"
35,in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I
35,felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in
35,"the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear"
35,"grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again"
35,"grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under"
35,my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One
35,"hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily"
35,in attitude to mount again.
35,
35,'But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I
35,looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote
35,"future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer"
35,"house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had"
35,"seen me, and their faces were directed towards me."
35,
35,'Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by
35,the White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of
35,these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon
35,which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps
35,"four feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a"
35,leather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish
35,"which--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his"
35,"head was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm"
35,the air was.
35,
35,"'He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but"
35,indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more
35,beautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used
35,to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence.
35,I took my hands from the machine.
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,IV
35,
35,
35,"'In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile"
35,thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my
35,eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at
35,once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and
35,spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue.
35,
35,"'There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps"
35,eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them
35,"addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was"
35,"too harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my"
35,"ears, shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then"
35,touched my hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my
35,back and shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was
35,"nothing in this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in"
35,these pretty little people that inspired confidence--a graceful
35,"gentleness, a certain childlike ease. And besides, they looked so"
35,frail that I could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them
35,about like nine-pins. But I made a sudden motion to warn them when I
35,saw their little pink hands feeling at the Time Machine. Happily
35,"then, when it was not too late, I thought of a danger I had hitherto"
35,"forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the machine I unscrewed the"
35,"little levers that would set it in motion, and put these in my"
35,pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in the way of
35,communication.
35,
35,"'And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some"
35,further peculiarities in their Dresden-china type of prettiness.
35,"Their hair, which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the"
35,neck and cheek; there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the
35,"face, and their ears were singularly minute. The mouths were small,"
35,"with bright red, rather thin lips, and the little chins ran to a"
35,point. The eyes were large and mild; and--this may seem egotism on
35,my part--I fancied even that there was a certain lack of the
35,interest I might have expected in them.
35,
35,"'As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood"
35,"round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I"
35,began the conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself.
35,"Then hesitating for a moment how to express time, I pointed to the"
35,sun. At once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and
35,"white followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the"
35,sound of thunder.
35,
35,"'For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was"
35,plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were
35,these creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me.
35,You see I had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight
35,Hundred and Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in
35,"knowledge, art, everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a"
35,question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of
35,"our five-year-old children--asked me, in fact, if I had come from"
35,the sun in a thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended
35,"upon their clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features."
35,A flow of disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt
35,that I had built the Time Machine in vain.
35,
35,"'I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering"
35,of a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so
35,"and bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of"
35,"beautiful flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck."
35,The idea was received with melodious applause; and presently they
35,"were all running to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging"
35,them upon me until I was almost smothered with blossom. You who
35,have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and
35,wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created. Then
35,someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the
35,"nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx of white marble,"
35,which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my
35,"astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone. As I"
35,went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a
35,"profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible"
35,"merriment, to my mind."
35,
35,"'The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal"
35,dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of
35,"little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me"
35,shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw
35,over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and
35,"flowers, a long neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number"
35,"of tall spikes of strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps"
35,"across the spread of the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if"
35,"wild, among the variegated shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine"
35,them closely at this time. The Time Machine was left deserted on the
35,turf among the rhododendrons.
35,
35,"'The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did"
35,"not observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw"
35,"suggestions of old Phoenician decorations as I passed through, and"
35,it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather-worn.
35,"Several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway, and so we"
35,"entered, I, dressed in dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking"
35,"grotesque enough, garlanded with flowers, and surrounded by an"
35,"eddying mass of bright, soft-colored robes and shining white limbs,"
35,in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech.
35,
35,'The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with
35,"brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed"
35,"with coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered"
35,light. The floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white
35,"metal, not plates nor slabs--blocks, and it was so much worn, as I"
35,"judged by the going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply"
35,channelled along the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length
35,"were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised"
35,"perhaps a foot from the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits."
35,"Some I recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange,"
35,but for the most part they were strange.
35,
35,'Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions.
35,"Upon these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do"
35,likewise. With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the
35,"fruit with their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into"
35,the round openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to
35,"follow their example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I"
35,surveyed the hall at my leisure.
35,
35,'And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look.
35,"The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical"
35,"pattern, were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung"
35,across the lower end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that
35,"the corner of the marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless,"
35,"the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque. There were,"
35,"perhaps, a couple of hundred people dining in the hall, and most of"
35,"them, seated as near to me as they could come, were watching me with"
35,"interest, their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating."
35,"All were clad in the same soft and yet strong, silky material."
35,
35,"'Fruit, by the by, was all their diet. These people of the remote"
35,"future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite"
35,"of some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I"
35,"found afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the"
35,Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;
35,"one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was"
35,"there--a floury thing in a three-sided husk--was especially good,"
35,and I made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange
35,"fruits, and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to"
35,perceive their import.
35,
35,"'However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future"
35,"now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to"
35,make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of
35,mine. Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a
35,"convenient thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began"
35,a series of interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some
35,considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts
35,"met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but"
35,presently a fair-haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention
35,and repeated a name. They had to chatter and explain the business
35,"at great length to each other, and my first attempts to make the"
35,exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount
35,"of amusement. However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children,"
35,"and persisted, and presently I had a score of noun substantives at"
35,"least at my command; and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and"
35,"even the verb ""to eat."" But it was slow work, and the little people"
35,"soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations, so I"
35,"determined, rather of necessity, to let them give their lessons in"
35,little doses when they felt inclined. And very little doses I found
35,"they were before long, for I never met people more indolent or more"
35,easily fatigued.
35,
35,"'A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was"
35,their lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of
35,"astonishment, like children, but like children they would soon stop"
35,examining me and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my
35,"conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that"
35,almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is
35,"odd, too, how speedily I came to disregard these little people. I"
35,went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as
35,my hunger was satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men
35,"of the future, who would follow me a little distance, chatter and"
35,"laugh about me, and, having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly"
35,"way, leave me again to my own devices."
35,
35,'The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great
35,"hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun."
35,At first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely
35,different from the world I had known--even the flowers. The big
35,building I had left was situated on the slope of a broad river
35,"valley, but the Thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present"
35,"position. I resolved to mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a"
35,"mile and a half away, from which I could get a wider view of this"
35,our planet in the year Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred
35,"and One A.D. For that, I should explain, was the date the little"
35,dials of my machine recorded.
35,
35,'As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly
35,help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I
35,"found the world--for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for"
35,"instance, was a great heap of granite, bound together by masses of"
35,"aluminium, a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled"
35,"heaps, amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like"
35,plants--nettles possibly--but wonderfully tinted with brown about
35,"the leaves, and incapable of stinging. It was evidently the derelict"
35,"remains of some vast structure, to what end built I could not"
35,"determine. It was here that I was destined, at a later date, to have"
35,a very strange experience--the first intimation of a still stranger
35,discovery--but of that I will speak in its proper place.
35,
35,"'Looking round with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I"
35,"rested for a while, I realized that there were no small houses to be"
35,"seen. Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household,"
35,had vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like
35,"buildings, but the house and the cottage, which form such"
35,"characteristic features of our own English landscape, had"
35,disappeared.
35,
35,"'""Communism,"" said I to myself."
35,
35,'And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the
35,"half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash,"
35,"I perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft"
35,"hairless visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem"
35,"strange, perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything"
35,"was so strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and"
35,in all the differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the
35,"sexes from each other, these people of the future were alike. And"
35,the children seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their
35,"parents. I judged, then, that the children of that time were"
35,"extremely precocious, physically at least, and I found afterwards"
35,abundant verification of my opinion.
35,
35,"'Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I"
35,felt that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what
35,one would expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a
35,"woman, the institution of the family, and the differentiation of"
35,occupations are mere militant necessities of an age of physical
35,"force; where population is balanced and abundant, much childbearing"
35,becomes an evil rather than a blessing to the State; where
35,"violence comes but rarely and off-spring are secure, there is less"
35,"necessity--indeed there is no necessity--for an efficient family,"
35,and the specialization of the sexes with reference to their
35,children's needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even
35,"in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I"
35,"must remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to"
35,appreciate how far it fell short of the reality.
35,
35,"'While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by"
35,"a pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in"
35,"a transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then"
35,resumed the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings
35,"towards the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently"
35,"miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a"
35,strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest.
35,
35,"'There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognize,"
35,corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered
35,"in soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of"
35,"griffins' heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of"
35,our old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and
35,fair a view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the
35,"horizon and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal"
35,"bars of purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in"
35,which the river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already
35,spoken of the great palaces dotted about among the variegated
35,"greenery, some in ruins and some still occupied. Here and there rose"
35,"a white or silvery figure in the waste garden of the earth, here and"
35,there came the sharp vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There
35,"were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of"
35,agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden.
35,
35,"'So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had"
35,"seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation"
35,was something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a
35,half-truth--or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)
35,
35,'It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane.
35,The ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the
35,first time I began to realize an odd consequence of the social
35,"effort in which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think,"
35,it is a logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need;
35,security sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the
35,conditions of life--the true civilizing process that makes life more
35,and more secure--had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a
35,united humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are
35,now mere dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and
35,carried forward. And the harvest was what I saw!
35,
35,"'After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of to-day are still"
35,in the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but
35,"a little department of the field of human disease, but even so,"
35,it spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our
35,agriculture and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and
35,"cultivate perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the"
35,greater number to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our
35,favourite plants and animals--and how few they are--gradually by
35,"selective breeding; now a new and better peach, now a seedless"
35,"grape, now a sweeter and larger flower, now a more convenient breed"
35,"of cattle. We improve them gradually, because our ideals are vague"
35,"and tentative, and our knowledge is very limited; because Nature,"
35,"too, is shy and slow in our clumsy hands. Some day all this will"
35,"be better organized, and still better. That is the drift of the"
35,"current in spite of the eddies. The whole world will be intelligent,"
35,"educated, and co-operating; things will move faster and faster"
35,"towards the subjugation of Nature. In the end, wisely and carefully"
35,we shall readjust the balance of animal and vegetable life to suit
35,our human needs.
35,
35,"'This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done"
35,"indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine"
35,"had leaped. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or"
35,fungi; everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers;
35,brilliant butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of
35,preventive medicine was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I
35,saw no evidence of any contagious diseases during all my stay. And I
35,shall have to tell you later that even the processes of putrefaction
35,and decay had been profoundly affected by these changes.
35,
35,"'Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in"
35,"splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them"
35,"engaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social"
35,"nor economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all"
35,"that commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It"
35,was natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of
35,a social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been
35,"met, I guessed, and population had ceased to increase."
35,
35,'But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to
35,"the change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is"
35,the cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:
35,"conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and"
35,the weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the
35,"loyal alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and"
35,"decision. And the institution of the family, and the emotions that"
35,"arise therein, the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring,"
35,"parental self-devotion, all found their justification and support in"
35,"the imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent"
35,"dangers? There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against"
35,"connubial jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion"
35,"of all sorts; unnecessary things now, and things that make us"
35,"uncomfortable, savage survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant"
35,life.
35,
35,"'I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of"
35,"intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my"
35,belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes
35,"Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had"
35,used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which
35,it lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions.
35,
35,"'Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that"
35,"restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness."
35,"Even in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary"
35,"to survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and"
35,"the love of battle, for instance, are no great help--may even be"
35,hindrances--to a civilized man. And in a state of physical balance
35,"and security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out"
35,of place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of
35,"war or solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting"
35,"disease to require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For"
35,"such a life, what we should call the weak are as well equipped as"
35,"the strong, are indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they"
35,"are, for the strong would be fretted by an energy for which there"
35,was no outlet. No doubt the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw
35,was the outcome of the last surgings of the now purposeless energy
35,of mankind before it settled down into perfect harmony with the
35,conditions under which it lived--the flourish of that triumph which
35,began the last great peace. This has ever been the fate of energy in
35,"security; it takes to art and to eroticism, and then come languor"
35,and decay.
35,
35,'Even this artistic impetus would at last die away--had almost died
35,"in the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to"
35,"sing in the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and"
35,no more. Even that would fade in the end into a contented
35,inactivity. We are kept keen on the grindstone of pain and
35,"necessity, and, it seemed to me, that here was that hateful"
35,grindstone broken at last!
35,
35,'As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this
35,simple explanation I had mastered the problem of the world--mastered
35,the whole secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they
35,"had devised for the increase of population had succeeded too well,"
35,and their numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary.
35,That would account for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my
35,"explanation, and plausible enough--as most wrong theories are!"
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,V
35,
35,
35,"'As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the"
35,"full moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver"
35,light in the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move
35,"about below, a noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the"
35,chill of the night. I determined to descend and find where I could
35,sleep.
35,
35,'I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to
35,"the figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing"
35,distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see
35,the silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron
35,"bushes, black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn."
35,I looked at the lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency.
35,"""No,"" said I stoutly to myself, ""that was not the lawn."""
35,
35,'But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was
35,towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came
35,home to me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!
35,
35,"'At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of"
35,"losing my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world."
35,The bare thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could
35,feel it grip me at the throat and stop my breathing. In another
35,moment I was in a passion of fear and running with great leaping
35,strides down the slope. Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost
35,"no time in stanching the blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a"
35,warm trickle down my cheek and chin. All the time I ran I was saying
35,"to myself: ""They have moved it a little, pushed it under the bushes"
35,"out of the way."" Nevertheless, I ran with all my might. All the"
35,"time, with the certainty that sometimes comes with excessive dread,"
35,"I knew that such assurance was folly, knew instinctively that the"
35,machine was removed out of my reach. My breath came with pain. I
35,suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill crest to the
35,"little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am not a young"
35,"man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in leaving the"
35,"machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and none"
35,answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit
35,world.
35,
35,'When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realized. Not a trace
35,of the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the
35,empty space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it
35,"furiously, as if the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then"
35,"stopped abruptly, with my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered"
35,"the sphinx, upon the bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in"
35,the light of the rising moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my
35,dismay.
35,
35,'I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put
35,"the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of"
35,their physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed
35,"me: the sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose"
35,"intervention my invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt"
35,"assured: unless some other age had produced its exact duplicate,"
35,the machine could not have moved in time. The attachment of the
35,levers--I will show you the method later--prevented any one from
35,"tampering with it in that way when they were removed. It had moved,"
35,"and was hid, only in space. But then, where could it be?"
35,
35,'I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running
35,"violently in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx,"
35,"and startling some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a"
35,"small deer. I remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes"
35,with my clenched fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding
35,"from the broken twigs. Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of"
35,"mind, I went down to the great building of stone. The big hall was"
35,"dark, silent, and deserted. I slipped on the uneven floor, and fell"
35,"over one of the malachite tables, almost breaking my shin. I lit a"
35,"match and went on past the dusty curtains, of which I have told you."
35,
35,"'There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon"
35,"which, perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I"
35,"have no doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming"
35,suddenly out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the
35,splutter and flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches.
35,"""Where is my Time Machine?"" I began, bawling like an angry child,"
35,laying hands upon them and shaking them up together. It must have
35,"been very queer to them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely"
35,"frightened. When I saw them standing round me, it came into my head"
35,that I was doing as foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do
35,"under the circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear."
35,"For, reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear"
35,must be forgotten.
35,
35,"'Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and, knocking one of the people"
35,"over in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again,"
35,out under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little
35,feet running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all
35,I did as the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected
35,nature of my loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from
35,my own kind--a strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved
35,"to and fro, screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory"
35,"of horrible fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of"
35,looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moon-lit
35,"ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last,"
35,of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute
35,"wretchedness. I had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when"
35,"I woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping"
35,round me on the turf within reach of my arm.
35,
35,"'I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how"
35,"I had got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion"
35,"and despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain,"
35,"reasonable daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the"
35,"face. I saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could"
35,"reason with myself. ""Suppose the worst?"" I said. ""Suppose the"
35,machine altogether lost--perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be
35,"calm and patient, to learn the way of the people, to get a clear"
35,"idea of the method of my loss, and the means of getting materials"
35,"and tools; so that in the end, perhaps, I may make another."" That"
35,"would be my only hope, perhaps, but better than despair. And, after"
35,"all, it was a beautiful and curious world."
35,
35,"'But probably, the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must"
35,"be calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force"
35,or cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about
35,"me, wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and"
35,travel-soiled. The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal
35,"freshness. I had exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about"
35,"my business, I found myself wondering at my intense excitement"
35,overnight. I made a careful examination of the ground about the
35,"little lawn. I wasted some time in futile questionings, conveyed, as"
35,"well as I was able, to such of the little people as came by. They"
35,"all failed to understand my gestures; some were simply stolid, some"
35,thought it was a jest and laughed at me. I had the hardest task in
35,the world to keep my hands off their pretty laughing faces. It was
35,"a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of fear and blind anger"
35,was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage of my perplexity.
35,"The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped in it, about"
35,midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of my feet
35,"where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine."
35,"There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow"
35,footprints like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed
35,"my closer attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said,"
35,"of bronze. It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep"
35,framed panels on either side. I went and rapped at these. The
35,pedestal was hollow. Examining the panels with care I found them
35,"discontinuous with the frames. There were no handles or keyholes,"
35,"but possibly the panels, if they were doors, as I supposed, opened"
35,from within. One thing was clear enough to my mind. It took no very
35,great mental effort to infer that my Time Machine was inside that
35,pedestal. But how it got there was a different problem.
35,
35,'I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes
35,and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned
35,"smiling to them and beckoned them to me. They came, and then,"
35,"pointing to the bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open"
35,it. But at my first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I
35,don't know how to convey their expression to you. Suppose you were
35,to use a grossly improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman--it is
35,how she would look. They went off as if they had received the last
35,"possible insult. I tried a sweet-looking little chap in white next,"
35,"with exactly the same result. Somehow, his manner made me feel"
35,"ashamed of myself. But, as you know, I wanted the Time Machine, and"
35,"I tried him once more. As he turned off, like the others, my temper"
35,"got the better of me. In three strides I was after him, had him by"
35,"the loose part of his robe round the neck, and began dragging him"
35,towards the sphinx. Then I saw the horror and repugnance of his
35,"face, and all of a sudden I let him go."
35,
35,'But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze
35,"panels. I thought I heard something stir inside--to be explicit,"
35,I thought I heard a sound like a chuckle--but I must have been
35,"mistaken. Then I got a big pebble from the river, and came and"
35,"hammered till I had flattened a coil in the decorations, and the"
35,verdigris came off in powdery flakes. The delicate little people
35,must have heard me hammering in gusty outbreaks a mile away on
35,"either hand, but nothing came of it. I saw a crowd of them upon the"
35,"slopes, looking furtively at me. At last, hot and tired, I sat down"
35,to watch the place. But I was too restless to watch long; I am too
35,"Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a problem for years,"
35,but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours--that is another matter.
35,
35,"'I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the"
35,"bushes towards the hill again. ""Patience,"" said I to myself. ""If you"
35,want your machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they
35,"mean to take your machine away, it's little good your wrecking their"
35,"bronze panels, and if they don't, you will get it back as soon as"
35,you can ask for it. To sit among all those unknown things before a
35,puzzle like that is hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this
35,"world. Learn its ways, watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses"
35,"at its meaning. In the end you will find clues to it all."" Then"
35,suddenly the humour of the situation came into my mind: the thought
35,of the years I had spent in study and toil to get into the future
35,"age, and now my passion of anxiety to get out of it. I had made"
35,myself the most complicated and the most hopeless trap that ever a
35,"man devised. Although it was at my own expense, I could not help"
35,myself. I laughed aloud.
35,
35,"'Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little"
35,"people avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had"
35,something to do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt
35,"tolerably sure of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no"
35,"concern and to abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course"
35,of a day or two things got back to the old footing. I made what
35,"progress I could in the language, and in addition I pushed my"
35,explorations here and there. Either I missed some subtle point or
35,their language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed
35,"of concrete substantives and verbs. There seemed to be few, if any,"
35,"abstract terms, or little use of figurative language. Their"
35,"sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to"
35,convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined
35,to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze
35,"doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory,"
35,until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural
35,"way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a"
35,circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.
35,
35,"'So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant"
35,richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the
35,"same abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material"
35,"and style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same"
35,blossom-laden trees and tree-ferns. Here and there water shone like
35,"silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and"
35,"so faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which"
35,"presently attracted my attention, was the presence of certain"
35,"circular wells, several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth."
35,"One lay by the path up the hill, which I had followed during my"
35,"first walk. Like the others, it was rimmed with bronze, curiously"
35,"wrought, and protected by a little cupola from the rain. Sitting by"
35,"the side of these wells, and peering down into the shafted darkness,"
35,"I could see no gleam of water, nor could I start any reflection"
35,with a lighted match. But in all of them I heard a certain sound:
35,"a thud--thud--thud, like the beating of some big engine; and I"
35,"discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady current of"
35,"air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper into the"
35,"throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was at"
35,once sucked swiftly out of sight.
35,
35,"'After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers"
35,standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was
35,often just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above
35,"a sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong"
35,"suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose"
35,true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to
35,associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an
35,"obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong."
35,
35,'And here I must admit that I learned very little of drains and
35,"bells and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my"
35,time in this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and
35,"coming times which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail"
35,"about building, and social arrangements, and so forth. But while"
35,such details are easy enough to obtain when the whole world is
35,"contained in one's imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to"
35,a real traveller amid such realities as I found here. Conceive the
35,"tale of London which a negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take"
35,"back to his tribe! What would he know of railway companies, of"
35,"social movements, of telephone and telegraph wires, of the Parcels"
35,"Delivery Company, and postal orders and the like? Yet we, at least,"
35,should be willing enough to explain these things to him! And even of
35,"what he knew, how much could he make his untravelled friend either"
35,"apprehend or believe? Then, think how narrow the gap between a negro"
35,"and a white man of our own times, and how wide the interval between"
35,myself and these of the Golden Age! I was sensible of much which was
35,"unseen, and which contributed to my comfort; but save for a general"
35,"impression of automatic organization, I fear I can convey very"
35,little of the difference to your mind.
35,
35,"'In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of"
35,crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me
35,"that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere"
35,"beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I"
35,"deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely"
35,"defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make"
35,"a further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm"
35,among this people there were none.
35,
35,'I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an
35,automatic civilization and a decadent humanity did not long endure.
35,Yet I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The
35,"several big palaces I had explored were mere living places, great"
35,"dining-halls and sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no"
35,appliances of any kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant
35,"fabrics that must at times need renewal, and their sandals, though"
35,"undecorated, were fairly complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow"
35,such things must be made. And the little people displayed no vestige
35,"of a creative tendency. There were no shops, no workshops, no sign"
35,of importations among them. They spent all their time in playing
35,"gently, in bathing in the river, in making love in a half-playful"
35,"fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I could not see how things"
35,were kept going.
35,
35,"'Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what,"
35,had taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. Why? For
35,"the life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too,"
35,those flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt--how shall
35,"I put it? Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and"
35,"there in excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others"
35,"made up of words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well,"
35,"on the third day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight"
35,Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to
35,me!
35,
35,"'That day, too, I made a friend--of a sort. It happened that, as I"
35,"was watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of"
35,them was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main
35,"current ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate"
35,"swimmer. It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange"
35,"deficiency in these creatures, when I tell you that none made the"
35,slightest attempt to rescue the weakly crying little thing which
35,"was drowning before their eyes. When I realized this, I hurriedly"
35,"slipped off my clothes, and, wading in at a point lower down, I"
35,caught the poor mite and drew her safe to land. A little rubbing of
35,"the limbs soon brought her round, and I had the satisfaction of"
35,seeing she was all right before I left her. I had got to such a low
35,estimate of her kind that I did not expect any gratitude from her.
35,"In that, however, I was wrong."
35,
35,'This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little
35,"woman, as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre"
35,"from an exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and"
35,presented me with a big garland of flowers--evidently made for me
35,and me alone. The thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had
35,been feeling desolate. At any rate I did my best to display my
35,appreciation of the gift. We were soon seated together in a little
35,"stone arbour, engaged in conversation, chiefly of smiles. The"
35,creature's friendliness affected me exactly as a child's might have
35,"done. We passed each other flowers, and she kissed my hands. I did"
35,"the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and found that her name was"
35,"Weena, which, though I don't know what it meant, somehow seemed"
35,appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a queer friendship
35,"which lasted a week, and ended--as I will tell you!"
35,
35,'She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She
35,"tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about"
35,"it went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last,"
35,exhausted and calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems
35,"of the world had to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come"
35,into the future to carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress
35,"when I left her was very great, her expostulations at the parting"
35,"were sometimes frantic, and I think, altogether, I had as much"
35,"trouble as comfort from her devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow,"
35,a very great comfort. I thought it was mere childish affection that
35,"made her cling to me. Until it was too late, I did not clearly know"
35,what I had inflicted upon her when I left her. Nor until it was too
35,"late did I clearly understand what she was to me. For, by merely"
35,"seeming fond of me, and showing in her weak, futile way that she"
35,"cared for me, the little doll of a creature presently gave my return"
35,to the neighbourhood of the White Sphinx almost the feeling of
35,coming home; and I would watch for her tiny figure of white and gold
35,so soon as I came over the hill.
35,
35,"'It was from her, too, that I learned that fear had not yet left the"
35,"world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the"
35,"oddest confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made"
35,"threatening grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she"
35,"dreaded the dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness"
35,to her was the one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate
35,"emotion, and it set me thinking and observing. I discovered then,"
35,"among other things, that these little people gathered into the great"
35,"houses after dark, and slept in droves. To enter upon them without a"
35,light was to put them into a tumult of apprehension. I never found
35,"one out of doors, or one sleeping alone within doors, after dark."
35,Yet I was still such a blockhead that I missed the lesson of that
35,"fear, and in spite of Weena's distress I insisted upon sleeping away"
35,from these slumbering multitudes.
35,
35,"'It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me"
35,"triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including"
35,"the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm."
35,But my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been
35,the night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had
35,"been restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and"
35,that sea anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps.
35,"I woke with a start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal"
35,"had just rushed out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again,"
35,but I felt restless and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour
35,"when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is"
35,"colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. I got up, and went down"
35,"into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the"
35,"palace. I thought I would make a virtue of necessity, and see the"
35,sunrise.
35,
35,"'The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor"
35,of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky
35,"black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless."
35,"And up the hill I thought I could see ghosts. There several times,"
35,"as I scanned the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw"
35,"a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the"
35,"hill, and once near the ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some"
35,dark body. They moved hastily. I did not see what became of them.
35,It seemed that they vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still
35,"indistinct, you must understand. I was feeling that chill,"
35,"uncertain, early-morning feeling you may have known. I doubted"
35,my eyes.
35,
35,"'As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on"
35,"and its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned"
35,the view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were
35,"mere creatures of the half light. ""They must have been ghosts,"" I"
35,"said; ""I wonder whence they dated."" For a queer notion of Grant"
35,"Allen's came into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and"
35,"leave ghosts, he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with"
35,them. On that theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight
35,"Hundred Thousand Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four"
35,"at once. But the jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these"
35,"figures all the morning, until Weena's rescue drove them out of my"
35,head. I associated them in some indefinite way with the white animal
35,I had startled in my first passionate search for the Time Machine.
35,"But Weena was a pleasant substitute. Yet all the same, they were"
35,soon destined to take far deadlier possession of my mind.
35,
35,'I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather
35,of this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun
35,"was hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that"
35,"the sun will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people,"
35,"unfamiliar with such speculations as those of the younger Darwin,"
35,forget that the planets must ultimately fall back one by one into
35,"the parent body. As these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze"
35,with renewed energy; and it may be that some inner planet had
35,"suffered this fate. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that the"
35,sun was very much hotter than we know it.
35,
35,"'Well, one very hot morning--my fourth, I think--as I was seeking"
35,shelter from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great
35,"house where I slept and fed, there happened this strange thing:"
35,"Clambering among these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery,"
35,whose end and side windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone.
35,"By contrast with the brilliancy outside, it seemed at first"
35,"impenetrably dark to me. I entered it groping, for the change from"
35,light to blackness made spots of colour swim before me. Suddenly I
35,"halted spellbound. A pair of eyes, luminous by reflection against"
35,"the daylight without, was watching me out of the darkness."
35,
35,'The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched
35,my hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was
35,afraid to turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which
35,humanity appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I
35,remembered that strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to
35,"some extent, I advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my"
35,voice was harsh and ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched
35,"something soft. At once the eyes darted sideways, and something"
35,"white ran past me. I turned with my heart in my mouth, and saw a"
35,"queer little ape-like figure, its head held down in a peculiar"
35,"manner, running across the sunlit space behind me. It blundered"
35,"against a block of granite, staggered aside, and in a moment was"
35,hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of ruined masonry.
35,
35,"'My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a"
35,"dull white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there"
35,"was flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it"
35,went too fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it
35,"ran on all-fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an"
35,instant's pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could
35,"not find it at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I"
35,came upon one of those round well-like openings of which I have told
35,"you, half closed by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me."
35,"Could this Thing have vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and,"
35,"looking down, I saw a small, white, moving creature, with large"
35,bright eyes which regarded me steadfastly as it retreated. It made
35,me shudder. It was so like a human spider! It was clambering down
35,"the wall, and now I saw for the first time a number of metal foot"
35,and hand rests forming a kind of ladder down the shaft. Then the
35,"light burned my fingers and fell out of my hand, going out as it"
35,"dropped, and when I had lit another the little monster had"
35,disappeared.
35,
35,'I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for
35,some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I
35,"had seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that"
35,"Man had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two"
35,distinct animals: that my graceful children of the Upper-world were
35,"not the sole descendants of our generation, but that this bleached,"
35,"obscene, nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir"
35,to all the ages.
35,
35,'I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an
35,underground ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And
35,"what, I wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly"
35,balanced organization? How was it related to the indolent serenity
35,"of the beautiful Upper-worlders? And what was hidden down there,"
35,at the foot of that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling
35,"myself that, at any rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there"
35,I must descend for the solution of my difficulties. And withal I
35,"was absolutely afraid to go! As I hesitated, two of the beautiful"
35,Upper-world people came running in their amorous sport across the
35,"daylight in the shadow. The male pursued the female, flinging"
35,flowers at her as he ran.
35,
35,"'They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned"
35,"pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form"
35,"to remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried"
35,"to frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more"
35,visibly distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my
35,"matches, and I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about"
35,"the well, and again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to"
35,"go back to Weena, and see what I could get from her. But my mind was"
35,already in revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and
35,sliding to a new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these
35,"wells, to the ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to"
35,say nothing of a hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the
35,fate of the Time Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion
35,towards the solution of the economic problem that had puzzled me.
35,
35,"'Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was"
35,subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which
35,made me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome
35,"of a long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was"
35,the bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the
35,"dark--the white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then,"
35,"those large eyes, with that capacity for reflecting light, are"
35,common features of nocturnal things--witness the owl and the cat.
35,"And last of all, that evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty"
35,"yet fumbling awkward flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar"
35,carriage of the head while in the light--all reinforced the theory
35,of an extreme sensitiveness of the retina.
35,
35,"'Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and"
35,these tunnellings were the habitat of the new race. The presence of
35,"ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes--everywhere, in"
35,"fact, except along the river valley--showed how universal were its"
35,"ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in"
35,this artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the
35,comfort of the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible
35,"that I at once accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this"
35,splitting of the human species. I dare say you will anticipate the
35,"shape of my theory; though, for myself, I very soon felt that it"
35,fell far short of the truth.
35,
35,"'At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed"
35,clear as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present
35,merely temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and
35,"the Labourer, was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will"
35,seem grotesque enough to you--and wildly incredible!--and yet even
35,now there are existing circumstances to point that way. There is
35,a tendency to utilize underground space for the less ornamental
35,purposes of civilization; there is the Metropolitan Railway in
35,"London, for instance, there are new electric railways, there are"
35,"subways, there are underground workrooms and restaurants, and they"
35,"increase and multiply. Evidently, I thought, this tendency had"
35,increased till Industry had gradually lost its birthright in the
35,sky. I mean that it had gone deeper and deeper into larger and ever
35,"larger underground factories, spending a still-increasing amount of"
35,"its time therein, till, in the end--! Even now, does not an East-end"
35,worker live in such artificial conditions as practically to be cut
35,off from the natural surface of the earth?
35,
35,"'Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people--due, no doubt, to"
35,"the increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf"
35,between them and the rude violence of the poor--is already leading
35,"to the closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the"
35,"surface of the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the"
35,prettier country is shut in against intrusion. And this same
35,widening gulf--which is due to the length and expense of the higher
35,educational process and the increased facilities for and temptations
35,towards refined habits on the part of the rich--will make that
35,"exchange between class and class, that promotion by intermarriage"
35,which at present retards the splitting of our species along lines
35,"of social stratification, less and less frequent. So, in the end,"
35,"above ground you must have the Haves, pursuing pleasure and comfort"
35,"and beauty, and below ground the Have-nots, the Workers getting"
35,continually adapted to the conditions of their labour. Once they
35,"were there, they would no doubt have to pay rent, and not a little"
35,"of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and if they refused,"
35,they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such of them as were
35,"so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would die; and, in"
35,"the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would become as"
35,"well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as happy in"
35,"their way, as the Upper-world people were to theirs. As it seemed to"
35,"me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed naturally"
35,enough.
35,
35,'The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different
35,shape in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and
35,"general co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real"
35,"aristocracy, armed with a perfected science and working to a logical"
35,conclusion the industrial system of to-day. Its triumph had not been
35,"simply a triumph over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the"
35,"fellow-man. This, I must warn you, was my theory at the time. I had"
35,no convenient cicerone in the pattern of the Utopian books. My
35,explanation may be absolutely wrong. I still think it is the
35,most plausible one. But even on this supposition the balanced
35,civilization that was at last attained must have long since passed
35,"its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay. The too-perfect"
35,security of the Upper-worlders had led them to a slow movement of
35,"degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and"
35,intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had
35,happened to the Under-grounders I did not yet suspect; but from what
35,"I had seen of the Morlocks--that, by the by, was the name by which"
35,these creatures were called--I could imagine that the modification
35,"of the human type was even far more profound than among the ""Eloi,"""
35,the beautiful race that I already knew.
35,
35,'Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time
35,"Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if"
35,"the Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And"
35,"why were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have"
35,"said, to question Weena about this Under-world, but here again I was"
35,"disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and"
35,presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the
35,"topic was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little"
35,"harshly, she burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my"
35,"own, I ever saw in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased"
35,"abruptly to trouble about the Morlocks, and was only concerned in"
35,banishing these signs of the human inheritance from Weena's eyes.
35,"And very soon she was smiling and clapping her hands, while I"
35,solemnly burned a match.

35,"'It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow"
35,up the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt
35,a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the
35,half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in
35,spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the
35,touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic
35,"influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began"
35,to appreciate.
35,
35,'The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a
35,little disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once
35,or twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive
35,no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great
35,hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that
35,night Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence.
35,"It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the"
35,"moon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark,"
35,"when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these"
35,"whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be"
35,more abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of
35,one who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time
35,Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these
35,underground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I
35,had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so
35,"horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the"
35,"well appalled me. I don't know if you will understand my feeling,"
35,but I never felt quite safe at my back.
35,
35,"'It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me"
35,further and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the
35,south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe
35,"Wood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century"
35,"Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any"
35,I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces
35,"or ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face"
35,"of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind"
35,"of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This"
35,"difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded"
35,"to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come"
35,upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I
35,"resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I"
35,returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next
35,morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the
35,"Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable"
35,"me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I"
35,"would make the descent without further waste of time, and started"
35,out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite
35,and aluminium.
35,
35,"'Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but"
35,"when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed"
35,"strangely disconcerted. ""Good-bye, little Weena,"" I said, kissing"
35,"her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet"
35,"for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for"
35,I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in
35,"amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she"
35,began to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition
35,"nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little"
35,"roughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I"
35,"saw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her."
35,Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.
35,
35,'I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The
35,descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from
35,"the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of"
35,"a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily"
35,cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of
35,"the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into"
35,"the blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after"
35,that experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and
35,"back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the"
35,"sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward,"
35,"I saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible,"
35,while little Weena's head showed as a round black projection. The
35,thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive.
35,"Everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when"
35,I looked up again Weena had disappeared.
35,
35,'I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go
35,"up the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while"
35,"I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with"
35,"intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a"
35,"slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the"
35,aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and
35,"rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I"
35,"was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the"
35,unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air
35,was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the
35,shaft.
35,
35,'I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching
35,"my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,"
35,"hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar"
35,"to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating"
35,"before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me"
35,"impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and"
35,"sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they"
35,reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see
35,"me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear"
35,"of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in"
35,"order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark"
35,"gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the"
35,strangest fashion.
35,
35,"'I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently"
35,different from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs
35,"left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before"
35,"exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ""You are"
35,"in for it now,"" and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the"
35,noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from
35,"me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match,"
35,"saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into"
35,utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it
35,was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.
35,
35,'Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose
35,"out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim"
35,"spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by,"
35,"was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly"
35,shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a
35,"little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The"
35,"Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember"
35,wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red
35,"joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big"
35,"unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and"
35,only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match
35,"burned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot"
35,in the blackness.
35,
35,'I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such
35,"an experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had"
35,started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would
35,certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances.
35,"I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to"
35,smoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough
35,matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that
35,"glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure."
35,"But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers"
35,"that Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and"
35,four safety-matches that still remained to me.
35,
35,'I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the
35,"dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered"
35,that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me
35,"until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I"
35,"had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to"
35,"whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I"
35,"stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling"
35,"over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I"
35,fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little
35,beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently
35,"disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The"
35,sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably
35,unpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of
35,thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I
35,"shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then"
35,I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more
35,"boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently,"
35,and shouted again--rather discordantly. This time they were not so
35,"seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came"
35,back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined
35,to strike another match and escape under the protection of its
35,"glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper"
35,"from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I"
35,had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the
35,"blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves,"
35,"and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me."
35,
35,"'In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no"
35,mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another
35,"light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine"
35,"how nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces"
35,"and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their"
35,"blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise"
35,"you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck"
35,my third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening
35,"into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great"
35,pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting
35,"hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I"
35,was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match ... and it
35,"incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now,"
35,"and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the"
35,"Morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed"
35,peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who
35,"followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a trophy."
35,
35,'That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or
35,thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest
35,difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful
35,"struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I"
35,"felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the"
35,"well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding"
35,sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean.
35,"Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of"
35,"others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible."
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,VII
35,
35,
35,"'Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto,"
35,"except during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine,"
35,"I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was"
35,staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought
35,"myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and"
35,by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome;
35,but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of
35,the Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I
35,"loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen"
35,into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it.
35,"Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him"
35,soon.
35,
35,'The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the
35,new moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first
35,incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now
35,such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights
35,might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer
35,interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at
35,least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for
35,the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that
35,the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that
35,my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might
35,"once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their"
35,mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two
35,species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding
35,"down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new"
35,"relationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed"
35,to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on
35,"sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable"
35,"generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface"
35,"intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and"
35,"maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the"
35,survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse
35,"paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport:"
35,because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the
35,"organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed."
35,"The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,"
35,"thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of"
35,the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back
35,changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew.
35,They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came
35,into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world.
35,It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it
35,"were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a"
35,question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a
35,"vague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was"
35,at the time.
35,
35,"'Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their"
35,"mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this"
35,"age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not"
35,paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend
35,myself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a
35,"fastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could"
35,face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in
35,realizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt
35,I could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I
35,shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined
35,me.
35,
35,"'I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but"
35,found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All
35,the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous
35,"climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the"
35,tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished
35,"gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening,"
35,"taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills"
35,"towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or"
35,"eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen"
35,the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively
35,"diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and"
35,a nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes
35,I wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long
35,"past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black"
35,against the pale yellow of the sky.
35,
35,"'Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but"
35,"after a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the"
35,"side of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers"
35,"to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at"
35,the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase
35,for floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose.
35,And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found...'
35,
35,"The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and"
35,"silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white"
35,"mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative."
35,
35,'As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over
35,"the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to"
35,return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant
35,"pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to"
35,make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her
35,Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the
35,dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an
35,"air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear,"
35,"remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the"
35,"sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my"
35,fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally
35,sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground
35,"beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks"
35,on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark.
35,In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of
35,their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my
35,Time Machine?
35,
35,"'So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night."
35,"The clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another"
35,came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's fears and
35,her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her
35,"and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her"
35,"arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face"
35,"against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and"
35,there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I
35,"waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number"
35,"of sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure,"
35,_minus_ the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of
35,"the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours"
35,before the old moon rose were still to come.
35,
35,'From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide
35,and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to
35,"it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in"
35,"particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my"
35,"shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no"
35,"longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my"
35,direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of
35,what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would
35,be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking
35,danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose
35,upon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the
35,tree-boles to strike against.
35,
35,"'I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I"
35,"decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the"
35,open hill.
35,
35,"'Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her"
35,"in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The"
35,"hill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood"
35,there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the
35,"stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of"
35,friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations
35,"had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is"
35,"imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since"
35,"rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it"
35,"seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as"
35,of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that
35,was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius.
35,And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet
35,shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.
35,
35,'Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all
35,the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable
35,"distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of"
35,the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great
35,precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty
35,times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that
35,"I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity,"
35,"all the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations,"
35,"languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as"
35,"I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these"
35,"frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white"
35,Things of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear
35,"that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a"
35,"sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen"
35,might be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping
35,"beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and"
35,forthwith dismissed the thought.
35,
35,'Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as
35,"I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find"
35,signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept
35,"very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at"
35,"times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward"
35,"sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon"
35,"rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking"
35,"it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then"
35,"growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had"
35,seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed
35,day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I
35,stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle
35,"and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes,"
35,and flung them away.
35,
35,"'I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and"
35,pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit
35,"wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones,"
35,laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such
35,thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the
35,"meat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from"
35,the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great
35,"flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human"
35,decay the Morlocks' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on
35,rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating
35,and exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His
35,prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so
35,these inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a
35,"scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote"
35,than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago.
35,And the intelligence that would have made this state of things a
35,torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere
35,"fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed"
35,upon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing
35,at my side!
35,
35,'Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming
35,"upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human"
35,selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon
35,"the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword"
35,"and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to"
35,him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy
35,in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great
35,"their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the"
35,"human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a"
35,sharer in their degradation and their Fear.
35,
35,'I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should
35,"pursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to"
35,make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That
35,"necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some"
35,"means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand,"
35,"for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks."
35,Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of
35,bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had
35,a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of
35,light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I
35,could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far
35,away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And
35,turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the
35,building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.

35,VIII
35,
35,
35,"'I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about"
35,"noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass"
35,"remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had"
35,fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high
35,"upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I"
35,"was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged"
35,Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though
35,"I never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or"
35,"might be happening, to the living things in the sea."
35,
35,'The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed
35,"porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some"
35,"unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might"
35,"help me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of"
35,"writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I"
35,"fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so"
35,human.
35,
35,'Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we
35,"found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many"
35,side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum.
35,"The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of"
35,miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then
35,"I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall,"
35,what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized
35,by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the
35,fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay
35,"beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had"
35,"dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn"
35,away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a
35,Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the
35,"side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away"
35,"the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own"
35,time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair
35,preservation of some of their contents.
35,
35,'Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South
35,"Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section,"
35,"and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the"
35,"inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and"
35,"had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine"
35,"hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if"
35,with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and
35,there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare
35,fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the
35,cases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as
35,I judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our
35,"footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping"
35,"glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very"
35,quietly took my hand and stood beside me.
35,
35,'And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an
35,"intellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it"
35,presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a
35,little from my mind.
35,
35,"'To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain"
35,had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology;
35,"possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me,"
35,"at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more"
35,interesting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay.
35,"Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the"
35,"first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a"
35,block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find
35,"no saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had"
35,"deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a"
35,"train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery,"
35,"though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had"
35,"little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on"
35,down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had
35,entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural
35,"history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A"
35,few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed
35,"animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a"
35,"brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that,"
35,because I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by
35,which the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we
35,"came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly"
35,"ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the"
35,end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the
35,ceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that
35,originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in
35,"my element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of"
35,"big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some"
35,still fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for
35,"mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as"
35,"for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make"
35,only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if
35,I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of
35,powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.
35,
35,'Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she
35,startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have
35,noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It
35,"may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum"
35,was built into the side of a hill.--ED.] The end I had come in at
35,"was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As"
35,"you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows,"
35,"until at last there was a pit like the ""area"" of a London house"
35,"before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went"
35,"slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent"
35,"upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until"
35,Weena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that
35,"the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and"
35,"then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant"
35,"and its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it"
35,appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My
35,sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that.
35,I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of
35,machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the
35,"afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means"
35,of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the
35,"gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had"
35,heard down the well.
35,
35,"'I took Weena's hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her"
35,and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike
35,"those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this"
35,"lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly"
35,"Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged"
35,"the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a"
35,"minute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than"
35,"sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I"
35,"longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may"
35,"think, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was"
35,"impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my"
35,"disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to"
35,"slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained"
35,me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I
35,heard.
35,
35,"'Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that"
35,"gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first"
35,glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags.
35,"The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I"
35,presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had
35,"long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left"
35,them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic
35,clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I
35,"might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition."
35,"But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the"
35,enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting
35,paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly
35,of the _Philosophical Transactions_ and my own seventeen papers upon
35,physical optics.
35,
35,"'Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have"
35,been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little
35,hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had
35,"collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every"
35,"unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases,"
35,I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were
35,"perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. ""Dance,"""
35,I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed
35,"against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict"
35,"museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge"
35,"delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling"
35,_The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a
35,"modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far"
35,"as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally"
35,"inventive, as you know."
35,
35,"'Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped"
35,"the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for"
35,"me it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far"
35,"unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed"
35,"jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed."
35,"I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass"
35,accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the
35,"universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive,"
35,perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a
35,sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil
35,Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions
35,"of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that"
35,"it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in"
35,"fact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no"
35,"explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze"
35,doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had
35,chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.
35,
35,'I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would
35,require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all
35,the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of
35,"arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a"
35,"sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised"
35,"best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols,"
35,"and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some"
35,"new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder"
35,there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was
35,"charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the"
35,"specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian,"
35,"Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think."
35,"And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon"
35,the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly
35,took my fancy.
35,
35,"'As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery"
35,"after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes"
35,"mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I"
35,"suddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the"
35,"merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite"
35,"cartridges! I shouted ""Eureka!"" and smashed the case with joy. Then"
35,"came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery,"
35,I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in
35,"waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came."
35,"Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from"
35,"their presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should"
35,"have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and"
35,"(as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together"
35,into non-existence.
35,
35,"'It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court"
35,"within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we"
35,rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider
35,"our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible"
35,hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little
35,"now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of"
35,all defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor
35,"in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that"
35,"the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open,"
35,protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the
35,"Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But"
35,"now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards"
35,"those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them,"
35,largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never
35,"impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of"
35,iron not altogether inadequate for the work.
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,IX
35,
35,
35,'We emerged from the palace while the sun was still in part above
35,the horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the
35,"next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods"
35,that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as
35,"far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep"
35,"in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I"
35,"gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms"
35,"full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had"
35,"anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from"
35,sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the
35,"wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped,"
35,fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending
35,"calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me"
35,"onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was"
35,"feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the"
35,Morlocks with it.
35,
35,"'While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim"
35,"against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was"
35,"scrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from"
35,"their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather"
35,less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare
35,"hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer"
35,resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could
35,contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was
35,evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should
35,"have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down."
35,And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind
35,by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this
35,"proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering"
35,our retreat.
35,
35,'I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must
35,be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun's
35,"heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by"
35,"dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts."
35,"Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to"
35,widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with
35,"the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In"
35,"this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on"
35,the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were
35,an altogether new and strange thing to Weena.
35,
35,'She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have
35,"cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up,"
35,"and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the"
35,wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking
35,"back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my"
35,"heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a"
35,curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed
35,"at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very"
35,"black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as"
35,"my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to"
35,"avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of"
35,remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of
35,my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my
35,"little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar."
35,
35,"'For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,"
35,"the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the"
35,throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a
35,pattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more
35,"distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had"
35,heard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the
35,"Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another"
35,"minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena"
35,"shivered violently, and became quite still."
35,
35,'It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did
35,"so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the"
35,"darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the"
35,"same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands,"
35,"too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck."
35,"Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the"
35,white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took
35,"a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light it as soon"
35,as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying
35,"clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground."
35,With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to
35,"breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground,"
35,and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the
35,"shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of"
35,the stir and murmur of a great company!
35,
35,'She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder
35,"and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In"
35,"manoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about"
35,"several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction"
35,"lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the"
35,Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to
35,think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp
35,"where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy"
35,"bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began"
35,collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness
35,round me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.
35,
35,"'The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,"
35,two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away.
35,"One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I"
35,felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of
35,"dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece"
35,"of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed"
35,"how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival"
35,"on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So,"
35,"instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began"
35,leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking
35,"smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my"
35,camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I
35,"tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could"
35,not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.
35,
35,"'Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have"
35,"made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in"
35,the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I
35,"felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was"
35,full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just
35,"to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had"
35,their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily
35,"felt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they"
35,gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had
35,"happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness"
35,of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of
35,"burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms,"
35,and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to
35,feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in
35,"a monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt"
35,"little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my"
35,hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled
35,"up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short,"
35,I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the
35,"succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment"
35,I was free.
35,
35,'The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard
35,"fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I"
35,determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my
35,"back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was"
35,full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices
35,"seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements"
35,grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the
35,blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were
35,afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The
35,darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the
35,"Morlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized,"
35,"with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an"
35,"incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the"
35,"wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish."
35,"As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap"
35,"of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I"
35,"understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was"
35,"growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks'"
35,flight.
35,
35,"'Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through"
35,"the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning"
35,forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for
35,"Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the"
35,"explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little"
35,"time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the"
35,Morlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward
35,so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to
35,strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open
35,"space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and"
35,"past me, and went on straight into the fire!"
35,
35,"'And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of"
35,all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright
35,as day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock
35,"or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was"
35,"another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already"
35,"writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of"
35,"fire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled"
35,"by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against"
35,each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their
35,"blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of"
35,"fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more."
35,But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the
35,"hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured"
35,"of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck"
35,no more of them.
35,
35,"'Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting"
35,loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one
35,"time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures"
35,would presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the
35,fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the
35,"fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about"
35,"the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of"
35,Weena. But Weena was gone.
35,
35,"'At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this"
35,"strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and"
35,"making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat"
35,"on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and"
35,"through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they"
35,"belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three"
35,"Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows"
35,"of my fists, trembling as I did so."
35,
35,'For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare.
35,I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat
35,"the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and"
35,"wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to"
35,rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw
35,Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the
35,"flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the"
35,streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening
35,"tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures,"
35,came the white light of the day.
35,
35,"'I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was"
35,plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I
35,cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the
35,"awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was"
35,almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about
35,"me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind"
35,of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out
35,"through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that"
35,"I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the"
35,remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and
35,"moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet"
35,"and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still"
35,"pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time"
35,"Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as"
35,"lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death"
35,"of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this"
35,"old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an"
35,actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely
35,"again--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of"
35,"this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing"
35,that was pain.
35,
35,'But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning
35,"sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose"
35,matches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,X
35,
35,
35,'About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of
35,yellow metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of
35,my arrival. I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and
35,could not refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here
35,"was the same beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same"
35,"splendid palaces and magnificent ruins, the same silver river"
35,running between its fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful
35,people moved hither and thither among the trees. Some were bathing
35,"in exactly the place where I had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave"
35,me a keen stab of pain. And like blots upon the landscape rose the
35,cupolas above the ways to the Under-world. I understood now what all
35,the beauty of the Over-world people covered. Very pleasant was their
35,"day, as pleasant as the day of the cattle in the field. Like the"
35,"cattle, they knew of no enemies and provided against no needs. And"
35,their end was the same.
35,
35,'I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had
35,been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly
35,"towards comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and"
35,"permanency as its watchword, it had attained its hopes--to come"
35,"to this at last. Once, life and property must have reached almost"
35,absolute safety. The rich had been assured of his wealth and
35,"comfort, the toiler assured of his life and work. No doubt in that"
35,"perfect world there had been no unemployed problem, no social"
35,question left unsolved. And a great quiet had followed.
35,
35,"'It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility"
35,"is the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal"
35,perfectly in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism.
35,Nature never appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are
35,useless. There is no intelligence where there is no change and no
35,need of change. Only those animals partake of intelligence that have
35,to meet a huge variety of needs and dangers.
35,
35,"'So, as I see it, the Upper-world man had drifted towards his"
35,"feeble prettiness, and the Under-world to mere mechanical industry."
35,But that perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical
35,"perfection--absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the"
35,"feeding of the Under-world, however it was effected, had become"
35,"disjointed. Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a"
35,"few thousand years, came back again, and she began below. The"
35,"Under-world being in contact with machinery, which, however perfect,"
35,"still needs some little thought outside habit, had probably retained"
35,"perforce rather more initiative, if less of every other human"
35,"character, than the Upper. And when other meat failed them, they"
35,turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden. So I say I saw it
35,in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two Thousand Seven
35,Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as mortal wit
35,"could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and as that I"
35,give it to you.
35,
35,"'After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and"
35,"in spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm"
35,"sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon"
35,"my theorizing passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my"
35,"own hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and"
35,refreshing sleep.
35,
35,'I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being
35,"caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on"
35,down the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one
35,"hand, and the other hand played with the matches in my pocket."
35,
35,'And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal
35,of the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid
35,down into grooves.
35,
35,"'At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter."
35,
35,"'Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner"
35,of this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket.
35,"So here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the"
35,"White Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost"
35,sorry not to use it.
35,
35,'A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal.
35,"For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks."
35,"Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the"
35,bronze frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it
35,had been carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that
35,the Morlocks had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in
35,their dim way to grasp its purpose.
35,
35,"'Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere"
35,"touch of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The"
35,bronze panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang.
35,I was in the dark--trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I
35,chuckled gleefully.
35,
35,'I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards
35,me. Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on
35,the levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one
35,little thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light
35,only on the box.
35,
35,'You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were
35,close upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at
35,"them with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the"
35,machine. Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had
35,"simply to fight against their persistent fingers for my levers, and"
35,"at the same time feel for the studs over which these fitted. One,"
35,"indeed, they almost got away from me. As it slipped from my hand,"
35,I had to butt in the dark with my head--I could hear the Morlock's
35,skull ring--to recover it. It was a nearer thing than the fight in
35,"the forest, I think, this last scramble."
35,
35,'But at last the lever was fitted and pulled over. The clinging
35,hands slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes.
35,I found myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already
35,described.
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,XI
35,
35,
35,'I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes
35,with time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the
35,"saddle, but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite"
35,"time I clung to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite"
35,"unheeding how I went, and when I brought myself to look at the dials"
35,again I was amazed to find where I had arrived. One dial records
35,"days, and another thousands of days, another millions of days, and"
35,"another thousands of millions. Now, instead of reversing the levers,"
35,"I had pulled them over so as to go forward with them, and when I"
35,came to look at these indicators I found that the thousands hand was
35,sweeping round as fast as the seconds hand of a watch--into
35,futurity.
35,
35,"'As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of"
35,things. The palpitating greyness grew darker; then--though I was
35,still travelling with prodigious velocity--the blinking succession
35,"of day and night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace,"
35,"returned, and grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much"
35,"at first. The alternations of night and day grew slower and slower,"
35,"and so did the passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed"
35,to stretch through centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over
35,"the earth, a twilight only broken now and then when a comet glared"
35,across the darkling sky. The band of light that had indicated the
35,sun had long since disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set--it
35,"simply rose and fell in the west, and grew ever broader and more"
35,"red. All trace of the moon had vanished. The circling of the stars,"
35,"growing slower and slower, had given place to creeping points of"
35,"light. At last, some time before I stopped, the sun, red and very"
35,"large, halted motionless upon the horizon, a vast dome glowing with"
35,"a dull heat, and now and then suffering a momentary extinction. At"
35,"one time it had for a little while glowed more brilliantly again,"
35,but it speedily reverted to its sullen red heat. I perceived by this
35,slowing down of its rising and setting that the work of the tidal
35,"drag was done. The earth had come to rest with one face to the sun,"
35,"even as in our own time the moon faces the earth. Very cautiously,"
35,"for I remembered my former headlong fall, I began to reverse"
35,my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands until the
35,thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no longer a
35,"mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines of a"
35,desolate beach grew visible.
35,
35,"'I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round."
35,"The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black,"
35,and out of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale
35,"white stars. Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and"
35,"south-eastward it grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by"
35,"the horizon, lay the huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The"
35,"rocks about me were of a harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of"
35,life that I could see at first was the intensely green vegetation
35,that covered every projecting point on their south-eastern face. It
35,was the same rich green that one sees on forest moss or on the
35,lichen in caves: plants which like these grow in a perpetual
35,twilight.
35,
35,'The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away
35,"to the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the"
35,"wan sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of"
35,wind was stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a
35,"gentle breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving"
35,and living. And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was
35,a thick incrustation of salt--pink under the lurid sky. There was a
35,"sense of oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing"
35,very fast. The sensation reminded me of my only experience of
35,"mountaineering, and from that I judged the air to be more rarefied"
35,than it is now.
35,
35,"'Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a"
35,thing like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into
35,"the sky and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The"
35,sound of its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself
35,"more firmly upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that,"
35,"quite near, what I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving"
35,slowly towards me. Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous
35,"crab-like creature. Can you imagine a crab as large as yonder table,"
35,"with its many legs moving slowly and uncertainly, its big claws"
35,"swaying, its long antennae, like carters' whips, waving and feeling,"
35,and its stalked eyes gleaming at you on either side of its metallic
35,"front? Its back was corrugated and ornamented with ungainly bosses,"
35,and a greenish incrustation blotched it here and there. I could see
35,the many palps of its complicated mouth flickering and feeling as it
35,moved.
35,
35,"'As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt"
35,a tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to
35,"brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost"
35,"immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught"
35,something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a
35,"frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna"
35,of another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes
35,"were wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with"
35,"appetite, and its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime,"
35,"were descending upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and"
35,I had placed a month between myself and these monsters. But I was
35,"still on the same beach, and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I"
35,"stopped. Dozens of them seemed to be crawling here and there, in the"
35,"sombre light, among the foliated sheets of intense green."
35,
35,'I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over
35,"the world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt"
35,"Dead Sea, the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring"
35,"monsters, the uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous"
35,"plants, the thin air that hurts one's lungs: all contributed to an"
35,"appalling effect. I moved on a hundred years, and there was the same"
35,"red sun--a little larger, a little duller--the same dying sea, the"
35,"same chill air, and the same crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in"
35,and out among the green weed and the red rocks. And in the westward
35,"sky, I saw a curved pale line like a vast new moon."
35,
35,"'So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a"
35,"thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth's fate,"
35,watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller
35,"in the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At"
35,"last, more than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of"
35,the sun had come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling
35,"heavens. Then I stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of"
35,"crabs had disappeared, and the red beach, save for its livid green"
35,"liverworts and lichens, seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with"
35,white. A bitter cold assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again
35,"came eddying down. To the north-eastward, the glare of snow lay"
35,under the starlight of the sable sky and I could see an undulating
35,crest of hillocks pinkish white. There were fringes of ice along the
35,"sea margin, with drifting masses further out; but the main expanse"
35,"of that salt ocean, all bloody under the eternal sunset, was still"
35,unfrozen.
35,
35,'I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A
35,certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the
35,"machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green"
35,slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A
35,shallow sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded
35,from the beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about
35,"upon this bank, but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I"
35,"judged that my eye had been deceived, and that the black object was"
35,merely a rock. The stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed
35,to me to twinkle very little.
35,
35,'Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun
35,"had changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I"
35,saw this grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this
35,"blackness that was creeping over the day, and then I realized that"
35,an eclipse was beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was
35,"passing across the sun's disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be"
35,"the moon, but there is much to incline me to believe that what I"
35,really saw was the transit of an inner planet passing very near to
35,the earth.
35,
35,'The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening
35,"gusts from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air"
35,increased in number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and
35,whisper. Beyond these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent?
35,It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of
35,"man, the bleating of sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects,"
35,the stir that makes the background of our lives--all that was over.
35,"As the darkness thickened, the eddying flakes grew more abundant,"
35,dancing before my eyes; and the cold of the air more intense. At
35,"last, one by one, swiftly, one after the other, the white peaks of"
35,the distant hills vanished into blackness. The breeze rose to a
35,moaning wind. I saw the black central shadow of the eclipse sweeping
35,towards me. In another moment the pale stars alone were visible. All
35,else was rayless obscurity. The sky was absolutely black.
35,
35,"'A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote"
35,"to my marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I"
35,"shivered, and a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow"
35,in the sky appeared the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to
35,recover myself. I felt giddy and incapable of facing the return
35,journey. As I stood sick and confused I saw again the moving thing
35,upon the shoal--there was no mistake now that it was a moving
35,"thing--against the red water of the sea. It was a round thing, the"
35,"size of a football perhaps, or, it may be, bigger, and tentacles"
35,trailed down from it; it seemed black against the weltering
35,"blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then I felt I"
35,was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that remote
35,and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the saddle.
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,XII
35,
35,
35,'So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon
35,the machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was
35,"resumed, the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with"
35,greater freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and
35,flowed. The hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again
35,"the dim shadows of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity."
35,"These, too, changed and passed, and others came. Presently, when the"
35,"million dial was at zero, I slackened speed. I began to recognize"
35,"our own pretty and familiar architecture, the thousands hand ran back"
35,"to the starting-point, the night and day flapped slower and slower."
35,"Then the old walls of the laboratory came round me. Very gently,"
35,"now, I slowed the mechanism down."
35,
35,'I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told
35,"you that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs."
35,"Watchett had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me,"
35,"like a rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when"
35,she traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to
35,be the exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower
35,"end opened, and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost,"
35,and disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered.
35,Just before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed
35,like a flash.
35,
35,"'Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar"
35,"laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got"
35,"off the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several"
35,minutes I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was
35,"my old workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept"
35,"there, and the whole thing have been a dream."
35,
35,"'And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east"
35,corner of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the
35,"north-west, against the wall where you saw it. That gives you the"
35,exact distance from my little lawn to the pedestal of the White
35,"Sphinx, into which the Morlocks had carried my machine."
35,
35,'For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came
35,"through the passage here, limping, because my heel was still"
35,"painful, and feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_"
35,"on the table by the door. I found the date was indeed to-day, and"
35,"looking at the timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o'clock. I"
35,heard your voices and the clatter of plates. I hesitated--I felt so
35,"sick and weak. Then I sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the"
35,"door on you. You know the rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am"
35,telling you the story.
35,
35,"'I know,' he said, after a pause, 'that all this will be absolutely"
35,incredible to you. To me the one incredible thing is that I am here
35,to-night in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces
35,and telling you these strange adventures.'
35,
35,He looked at the Medical Man. 'No. I cannot expect you to believe
35,it. Take it as a lie--or a prophecy. Say I dreamed it in the
35,workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon the destinies of our
35,race until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my assertion of its
35,truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest. And taking
35,"it as a story, what do you think of it?'"
35,
35,"He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap"
35,with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary
35,stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the
35,"carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller's face, and looked"
35,"round at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of"
35,colour swam before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the
35,contemplation of our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end
35,of his cigar--the sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The
35,"others, as far as I remember, were motionless."
35,
35,The Editor stood up with a sigh. 'What a pity it is you're not
35,"a writer of stories!' he said, putting his hand on the Time"
35,Traveller's shoulder.
35,
35,'You don't believe it?'
35,
35,'Well----'
35,
35,'I thought not.'
35,
35,The Time Traveller turned to us. 'Where are the matches?' he said.
35,"He lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. 'To tell you the truth"
35,... I hardly believe it myself.... And yet...'
35,
35,His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers
35,upon the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his
35,"pipe, and I saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his"
35,knuckles.
35,
35,"The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers."
35,"'The gynaeceum's odd,' he said. The Psychologist leant forward to"
35,"see, holding out his hand for a specimen."
35,
35,"'I'm hanged if it isn't a quarter to one,' said the Journalist."
35,'How shall we get home?'
35,
35,"'Plenty of cabs at the station,' said the Psychologist."
35,
35,"'It's a curious thing,' said the Medical Man; 'but I certainly don't"
35,know the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?'
35,
35,The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: 'Certainly not.'
35,
35,'Where did you really get them?' said the Medical Man.
35,
35,The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who
35,was trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. 'They were put
35,"into my pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.' He stared"
35,round the room. 'I'm damned if it isn't all going. This room and you
35,and the atmosphere of every day is too much for my memory. Did I
35,"ever make a Time Machine, or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all"
35,"only a dream? They say life is a dream, a precious poor dream at"
35,times--but I can't stand another that won't fit. It's madness. And
35,where did the dream come from? ... I must look at that machine. If
35,there is one!'
35,
35,"He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through"
35,the door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering
35,"light of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and"
35,"askew; a thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering"
35,quartz. Solid to the touch--for I put out my hand and felt the rail
35,"of it--and with brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of"
35,"grass and moss upon the lower parts, and one rail bent awry."
35,
35,"The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand"
35,"along the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story I"
35,told you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you out here in the
35,"cold.' He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we"
35,returned to the smoking-room.
35,
35,He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his
35,"coat. The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain"
35,"hesitation, told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he"
35,"laughed hugely. I remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling"
35,good night.
35,
35,I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a 'gaudy lie.'
35,For my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was
35,"so fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I"
35,lay awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go
35,next day and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the
35,"laboratory, and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him."
35,"The laboratory, however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the"
35,Time Machine and put out my hand and touched the lever. At that the
35,squat substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the
35,"wind. Its instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer"
35,reminiscence of the childish days when I used to be forbidden to
35,meddle. I came back through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me
35,in the smoking-room. He was coming from the house. He had a small
35,camera under one arm and a knapsack under the other. He laughed when
35,"he saw me, and gave me an elbow to shake. 'I'm frightfully busy,'"
35,"said he, 'with that thing in there.'"
35,
35,'But is it not some hoax?' I said. 'Do you really travel through
35,time?'
35,
35,'Really and truly I do.' And he looked frankly into my eyes. He
35,hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. 'I only want half an
35,"hour,' he said. 'I know why you came, and it's awfully good of you."
35,There's some magazines here. If you'll stop to lunch I'll prove you
35,"this time travelling up to the hilt, specimen and all. If you'll"
35,forgive my leaving you now?'
35,
35,"I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,"
35,and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of
35,"the laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily"
35,paper. What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly
35,I was reminded by an advertisement that I had promised to meet
35,"Richardson, the publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw"
35,that I could barely save that engagement. I got up and went down the
35,passage to tell the Time Traveller.
35,
35,"As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation,"
35,"oddly truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air"
35,"whirled round me as I opened the door, and from within came the"
35,sound of broken glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was
35,"not there. I seemed to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in"
35,a whirling mass of black and brass for a moment--a figure so
35,transparent that the bench behind with its sheets of drawings was
35,absolutely distinct; but this phantasm vanished as I rubbed my eyes.
35,"The Time Machine had gone. Save for a subsiding stir of dust, the"
35,"further end of the laboratory was empty. A pane of the skylight had,"
35,"apparently, just been blown in."
35,
35,I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had
35,"happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange"
35,"thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,"
35,and the man-servant appeared.
35,
35,We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. 'Has Mr. ----
35,gone out that way?' said I.
35,
35,"'No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him"
35,here.'
35,
35,At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I
35,"stayed on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second,"
35,"perhaps still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he"
35,would bring with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must
35,"wait a lifetime. The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And,"
35,"as everybody knows now, he has never returned."
35,
35,
35,
35,
35,EPILOGUE
35,
35,
35,One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he
35,"swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy"
35,savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the
35,"Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian"
35,brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now--if I may use the
35,phrase--be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral
35,"reef, or beside the lonely saline lakes of the Triassic Age. Or did"
35,"he go forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still"
35,"men, but with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome"
35,"problems solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own"
35,"part, cannot think that these latter days of weak experiment,"
35,"fragmentary theory, and mutual discord are indeed man's culminating"
35,"time! I say, for my own part. He, I know--for the question had been"
35,discussed among us long before the Time Machine was made--thought
35,"but cheerlessly of the Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the"
35,growing pile of civilization only a foolish heaping that must
35,inevitably fall back upon and destroy its makers in the end. If that
35,"is so, it remains for us to live as though it were not so. But to me"
35,"the future is still black and blank--is a vast ignorance, lit at a"
35,"few casual places by the memory of his story. And I have by me, for"
35,"my comfort, two strange white flowers--shrivelled now, and brown and"
35,flat and brittle--to witness that even when mind and strength had
35,"gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart"
35,of man.
