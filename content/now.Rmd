Unlike an *about* page, this page is meant to give a sense of what I'm doing & working on *now*. If we haven't run into each other recently, here's what I might say to catch you up:

- I'm settling into my new role in OIT, working as a data warehouse developer. I've been building new skills with Oracle technologies, specifically PL/SQL, ODI, and OAC/OBIEE. I'm currently assisting with production support, redesigning dashboards on enrollment information, and working with two teammates to centralize our documentation in a team wiki.

- My part-time classes are going well; I'm done with my first exams for MATH-287 (Mathematical Proofs & Methods) and MATH-471 (Data Analysis). I've been enjoying learning more LaTeX in 287, and definitely feel like I'm getting the experience I wanted as far as proof-writing practice.

<!-- - I've been too busy recently to focus on the weekly [#tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) event that's hosted by the R4DS community. You can find my contributions on [twitter.](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday%20(from%3Amooreaw_%20OR%20from%3Andrewwm)&src=typed_query&f=live){target="_blank"} -->

- I don't have much time for side-projects currently, but I'm hoping I can consolidate some materials into a more coherent portfolio (perhaps a Shiny app or two) to share with folks. I'd also like to make some progress on my `scRyfall` [package.](https://github.com/ndrewwm/scRyfall/)
