<p>So, this is a small thing, but something I‚Äôm proud of. Over the past year, I‚Äôve been practicing German (üá©üá™ <em>Ich habe Deutsch gelernt!</em>) using Duolingo‚Äôs mobile app. I don‚Äôt have an especially romantic reason for why I settled on the language, but I had watched the first season of <em>Dark</em> on Netflix in 2018, and don‚Äôt really enjoy dubbed foreign film/tv. Listening to the language prompted me to try a few lessons initially, but I settled into routine practice while finishing <em>Babylon Berlin</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> last fall. I don‚Äôt remember setting an explicit goal to reach a year of daily practice, but we‚Äôre coming up on that point. According to the app, I‚Äôve been on a streak of 217 days! <em>Leider habe ich nicht jeden Tag ge√ºbt.</em> There were several days where I missed my usual 20-25 minutes of practice, but Duolingo lets you purchase ‚Äústreak freezes‚Äù with in-app currency to preserve your progress. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of my streak(s) over the past 8 months.</p>

<p>So, each freeze is a day that I‚Äôm ‚Äúbehind‚Äù on my goal. If I‚Äôve used 26 freezes now, how many more should I expect over the next 4-ish months? I started right around the end of August, so 17 weeks from now would be close to my 1-year mark of daily practice. When counting the number of freezes on a weekly basis, the distribution looks fairly close to a Poisson distribution.</p>

<p>Maybe my data isn‚Äôt a perfect fit to a Poisson distribution with the same mean, but perhaps it‚Äôs close enough to serve as a model for what we can expect. So, to be specific, let‚Äôs let</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> = the number of streak freezes used in a 7-day period, where <span class="math inline">\(X \sim Poisson(\lambda = 0.722)\)</span>.
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>We can then simulate 17 weeks from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and sum the results, repeating this process say, 10,000 times. Or, more formally, we end up with a vector of sums <span class="math inline">\(\vec{s}\)</span>:</p>
<center>
<span class="math inline">\(\vec{s} = \begin{bmatrix}s_1 \\ s_2 \\ \vdots \\ s_j \end{bmatrix} \text{ where } j = 1, 2, 3, \cdots, 10,000, \text{ and } s_j = \sum_{i=1}^{17}[\vec{x}_i]\)</span>, if we let <span class="math inline">\(\vec{x}\)</span> be the <span class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> sample from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>For this simulation, we‚Äôre assuming that the results of each week are independent of each other. This feels reasonable to me; autocorrelation in my tabulated weekly counts seems negligible.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> All that‚Äôs left is to set up a loop to collect the simulation results, and then we‚Äôll use a histogram to visualize them. <!-- acf(weekly$n, plot = FALSE) --></p>
<pre class="r"><code>X &lt;- Poisson(0.722)
s &lt;- c()

for (b in 1:10000) {
  x &lt;- random(X, n = 17)
  s &lt;- c(s, sum(x))
}

ggplot(tibble(s), aes(x = s)) +
  geom_histogram(color = &quot;white&quot;, bins = 15) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  theme(plot.caption = ggtext::element_markdown()) +
  labs(
    x = &quot;Total # of simulated freezes observed over 17 weeks&quot;, y = &quot;N&quot;,
    caption = str_glue(
      &quot;*s*&lt;sub&gt;Mean&lt;/sub&gt; = {round(mean(s), 2)}, *s*&lt;sub&gt;SD&lt;/sub&gt; = {round(sd(s), 2)} &quot;,
      &quot;Pr(8 &amp;le; *s* &amp;le; 13) = {sum(between(s, 8, 13)) / length(s)}&lt;br&gt;&quot;,
      &quot;Pr(7 &amp;le; *s* &amp;le; 21) = {sum(between(s, 7, 21)) / length(s)}&quot;
    )
  )</code></pre>

<p>We end up with a fairly normal-looking histogram, as would be expected by the central limit theorem.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> If the model is appropriate, it seems like I should expect between 8 to 13 additional freezes to be accumulated over this time period. The simulation results suggest there‚Äôs only a 22% chance that the number of freezes accumulated will be less than 10. Pulling everything together, by the end of August I‚Äôll probably be between 34 and 39 streak-freezes deep. This means it‚Äôll be at least a month after my starting point before I can truly claim I‚Äôve met my goal. üò≠</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>update/edit: in the process of wrapping up this post, I came across this <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/451996">question/answer</a> on SO, which suggests that my distribution here is actually <em>Poisson</em>, not normal. Theory would say we‚Äôre looking at a new Poisson distribution with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = 0.722 \times 17 = 12.274\)</span>. The new <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is quite close to the sample mean from the simulation (the sample variance is a little off, but this is probably to be expected from the randomness of the simulation). I feel a bit silly about forgetting and then relearning about Poisson processes, but it was interesting to work through things.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">‚Ü©Ô∏é</a></p></li>
