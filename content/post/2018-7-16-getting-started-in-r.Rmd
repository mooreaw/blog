Here's some evergreen advice from David Robinson:

```{r echo = FALSE}

```

In a world of countless data science blogs, I've decided to write a quick post about getting started in R. I recently crossed Robinson's threshold, and want to put the bulk of my response here. I work in an academic research environment, and while I've used R for 6+ years, my initial exposure to working with data was in SPSS. My experience talking about R has often been in this community, speaking to SPSS/STATA users looking to expand their skills in a new software environment. The audience for this post is those who've decided to make the jump, and want to get started (rather than convincing you why R is a good choice). <!-- link to good posts about this? --> Aside from having this group in mind, I also want to provide a resource that's fairly current for 2018. R as a language is moving fast, and new(er) packages have given R a lot of strengths that I think are important to be aware of early.

Many folks I talk to about getting started with R have little or no experience with "real" programming languages, which described myself when I first installed R. If you're in this camp, I have a few recommendations to get started.

### 1. don't just install the R language-- install RStudio

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) is an *integrated development environment (IDE);* it provides a sort of look and feel for how you'll work with R. When programming, you'll be writing code in a text editor. IDEs are sensitive to code is written and help the user by highlighting parts of the syntax, and even auto-completing commands. RStudio also has tools for plotting and visualization, among many other useful features. RStudio's desktop version is *free,* so definitely take advantage of the standard setup for most people working with R.

### 2a. something to read

Once you've got the language and RStudio installed, I would point you to a book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, [R for Data Science.](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) As a resource, it's a little over a year old, so the topics and packages utilized are current (in my opinion). To my continued amazement, the book exists for *free* as a website, and the material is of high quality. The chapters cover importing data, transforming & cleaning data, and creating visualizations, in addition to sections on modeling and communicating analysis results. These initial 3 sections are the bread and butter of using R, and will teach you how to accomplish them using packages from the `tidyverse` (very few scripts I write don't include `library(tidyverse)` at the top of the file, so I think this is an important place to start in 2018).

### 2b. something to watch

If you're looking for something a little more interactive or perhaps lecture-esque, I would suggest looking at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r), and looking at the introductory courses offered. DataCamp is an online learning platform in which learners can run code in an online prompt alongside exercises. Courses include lectures and other components. They're self-paced, and each individual course can be completed over a few days. Some content is free, but a subscription might be needed to finish certain courses. Students are typically offered discounts, otherwise you're looking at around $29/month.

# walking

If you have a grasp of the basics, have run some code in RStudio, and are getting ready to embark on a project, I'll give a quick nod to the open secret of programming today. Your google-fu and ability to use [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) will both complement and reinforce your grasp of R as a language. In advising beginners, I always tell them to work with problems they encounter, and roll with the error messages they receive before consulting a more experienced user. I don't like seeing people struggle and am always happy to help those I'm working with, but each time you push yourself helps build your skills to 1) describe the problem you're facing, and 2) your ability to address and solve the issues you encounter. I'm skeptical that there's ever a point when a person will write error-free code on the first iteration of a project. Finding bugs doesn't mean you're failing, it just means that you're programming.

Next, I'd give a plug for something I've found valuable in my own learning and development: meetups. This is unfortunately location-dependent, but if you're in a larger city or college-town, it's fairly likely that there's an R User group that meets somewhat regularly. Most meetups I'm aware of are focused around talks on how to do something in R, or how R was applied to solve a given problem. For example, you might see overviews and demonstrations of new packages, or discussions of different statistical/visualization techniques and how they're implemented in R. I don't do a whole lot of machine learning in my day-to-day work, but I've found it very helpful to be plugged into the community of people in my city who do this kind of work. That last point underscores another benefit of meetups: you'll get to meet and talk to a lot of people you can learn from. I think this kind of experience is great for a beginner, or those early in their careers (this was and still is true for me).

If I was to place myself in one of the sections I'm covering, it would be here. Hopefully, you're at a point where you're able to use your skills as part of your work, but (based on your duties and project demands), this may or may not be happening. In any case, there are some things I've found myself doing to keep sharpening my skills. The first resource I would point you to is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle is another online platform, but is frequently used to host competitions. Companies or non-profits will host data they want analyzed, and individuals or teams can compete to build models that can best predict an outcome or solve a problem of interest. You can write code in the cloud-- no local environment is required, but you can download data to work with locally (if that's your thing). This is especially helpful to practice on real world problems, and gain experience with datasets that you wouldn't normally encounter in your field/discipline. A useful feature is that you'll often be able to see how others have approached solving the same problem ("kernels" or scripts that others have written are often public, and are linked to competitions/datasets).

The second thing I'd suggest is starting a GitHub account, and to begin curating some of your projects. I've found that a great way to learn is by hunting down interesting datasets and 

I hope you found this useful!
