<p>Unlike an <em>about</em> page, this page is meant to give a sense of what I’m doing &amp; working on <em>now</em>. If we haven’t run into each other recently, here’s what I might say to catch you up:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I changed roles at Boise State! My home is now in the Office of Information Technology (OIT), rather than Institutional Research (IR). I’ll be leveraging my existing knowledge of our student data warehouse to help improve our ETL, and build capacity in our cloud-based warehouse environments.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m taking classes part-time. While I’m formally a non-degree-seeking student at Boise State, I’m basically following the core curriculum for a math major. Last year I completed multivarible calculus and an intro to linear algebra course. This fall I intend to take MATH-287 (“Mathematical Proofs &amp; Methods”), which is a prerequisite for MATH-401 (“Intro to Real Analysis”), offered in the spring.</p></li>
<li><p>When I have time, I’m participating in the weekly <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">#tidytuesday</a> event that’s hosted by the R4DS community. I’m glad to have an event like this to keep my plotting and data-analysis skills sharp. It’s also been good to stretch on presentation and design. You can find my contributions on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday%20(from%3Amooreaw_%20OR%20from%3Andrewwm)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live" target="_blank">twitter.</a></p></li>
<li><p>I’m teaching myself CSS/HTML on freecodecamp.com. These languages have been a bit of a weak point for me, even though I’ve needed to apply them when working on Shiny applications or managing my websites/blog.</p></li>
</ul>
